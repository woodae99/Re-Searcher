# Example ontology for Re‑Searcher
#
# This file illustrates how to define a simple conceptual framework for use
# with Re‑Searcher.  Each top‑level key under ``concepts`` represents a
# concept name; the value is a list of related terms or synonyms.  When a
# user submits a query containing either the concept name or any of its
# synonyms, the system will expand the query to include all of the listed
# terms.  For example, searching for ``emergence`` or ``self‑organization``
# will search for both terms.
