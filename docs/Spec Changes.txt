Things to add to re-searcher

Read with your proposed architectural changes:


# Indexing
## Setting up the index / sources
have a settings page in the UI where index sources can be configured
2.1 should be able to add multiple sources to the index - folders, web, etc.
2.2 add/remove a file or folder to the index. Folder sources should be able to scan child folders, too
2.3 add/remove a web source, such as a web page or site (Wikipedia, or some entry in https://plato.stanford.edu/ for example)

## Managing the index
some pdf's are readable to the eye, but for some reason, copying and pasting text from them results in garbage characters - so where the content of an import looks dodgy, put it in a log for the user to review
be able to delete items from the index
be able to manually add an item to the index -e.g. a file, web site (crawl)
periodically scan or changes and update the index
be able to manually initiate a source scan and index update
be able to flush the index and "factory reset", clear caches and so on - return to a squeaky clean environment

# System
detect os, hardware and install appropriate, e.g. NVidia dependencies (my use case is Windows, but maintaining an Ubuntu variant would be good, too)
streamline installation (env set up, configuration choices, and app start-up) (this might be something to consider at the end of development)

# UI
1. update the date handling feature - presets: "Past 12 months", "Past 5 years", "Custom", with "From and "To" date picker
2. sort search results by:
2.1 score (relevance)
2.2 date
2.3 file/source 
2.4 file name
2.5 author surname (if possible. Zotero should be easy, other doc types may not be obvious. some md files have an author field defined in the yaml header or else "unknown"
3. filter search results by:
- source type - e.g. pdf/epub, md file, other (that might be added later)
4. Save searches
- have a button that saves current search and list saved searches in the left panel, have the ability to support a hierarchy, like Topic - subtopic - sub-subtopic these are not necessarily related or dependent e.g. 
- "Coaching Efficacy" 
-- "Conceptualisation of Efficacy"
-- "Evidence For..."
-- "Critiques of"

# Dream Functions
- Be able to make analytics tables? e.g. where are conceptual efficacy AND evidence for, found. Or - put these into a visual data graph with clickable links
- Be able to drill down into a search or document, a kind of "search within a search"

# Ontologies
- a visual ontology designer/editor 
- a way to show searches (if possible) like a visual graph display

# Housekeeping
- remove the builds for previous versions of python.
- Policy - use latest versions of components wherever possible

Questions
- how to quit the UI terminal?
