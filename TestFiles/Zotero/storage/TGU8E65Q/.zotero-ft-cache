Abstract
Methodology and research supporting coaching’s effectiveness has not kept up with its growth and demand. The current literature on coaching is lacking sufficient empirical rigour and does not meet the standard required for mixed methods design. This metaanalysis investigated the outcomes of coaching, and potential moderating effects of other factors, using only randomised control trial studies. Outcomes studied included performance, well-being, coping, work attitudes, and goal-directed self-regulation. There were no moderating effects identified from participant age, type of measure, or author(s). The results showed that overall coaching has a moderate significant positive effect on coachees, p̂ = 0.42, which indicated that coaching is effective for individuals.
Key Words: executive coaching, randomised control trial, meta-analysis, outcomes, development.
Introduction
Executive coaching has developed from a scarcely used leadership development practice in the late 1980s to its current position among the most effective and commonly used tools benefiting leaders (Coutu & Kauffman, 2009; McGovern et al., 2001; Tobias, 1996). Given that the principal concern for those practising coaching is the presence of untrained coaches (International Coach Federation, 2012), the influence of psychologists and their accompanying understanding of best practice methodology and assessment may help improve the quality of coaching provided by all coaches. Beyond the significant financial investment made by participating companies, coaching takes an individual away from their work with the premise that there will be a return on the investment and consequently there is a duty to prove that it actually works. Despite its popularity, the question remains: What makes it effective?

Psychological Theories Relevant to Coaching
There are many psychological theories underpinning the coaching process, such as goal setting, feedback, and identification of more severe underlying issues in clients. For example, a meta-analysis (Kluger & DeNisi, 1996) found that, on average, feedback interventions improved performance. However, certain types of tasks and motives changed this effect. Therefore, leveraging this knowledge of which types of feedback are relevant for certain situations could be instrumental in improving the client’s outcomes.
Another area where psychology can add value to coaching is through empirical rigour. Within the coaching literature, there is a distinct lack of best practice approaches when it comes to assessing the efficacy of the coaching intervention (De Meuse et al., 2009). Recent reviews from the USA and UK suggest that only a small proportion of organisations are accurately evaluating the outcomes of coaching; less than 10 per cent in USA and only 19 per cent in the UK (Bolch, 2001; Hay Group, 2002). If clients and organisations merely observe improvements at face value without objective measurement throughout the coaching process, there cannot be any proof of that development.
While there has been a marked increase in the number of qualitative reviews and peer-reviewed journal publications on coaching (Grant & Cavanagh, 2004), little progress has been achieved by way of pre- post studies to demonstrate improvements following a coaching intervention. There is also a distinct lack of control groups in pre- post executive coaching assessments. De Meuse, Dai, and Lee (2009) claim that including control groups is not possible due to the very nature of coaching objectives, as they constantly change and adapt to changing requirements. However, others such as Stober and Grant (2006) have attempted, with success, to randomly include control participants in coaching research. According to Grant, Passmore, Cavanagh, and Parker (2010), since the first known randomised control study conducted by Deviney (1994) there had been eleven betweensubjects studies that had successfully compared control to experimental groups in research (see Grant, Green, & Rynsardt, 2013; Moen & Federici, 2012).
Regardless of whether a worker has received coaching or not, learning and behavioural transformation are likely to occur, albeit at theoretically slower rates than in the presence of coaching. As many biases exist within a one to one relationship it is critical to measure interventions against randomised control groups. Research that does not include a comparison group is at risk of applying too much credit to coaching for the measured changes. For example, Smither, London, Flautt, Vargas and Kucine (2003) found that measuring the effect of coaching against controls returned positive yet small improvements. At the time, this was the only published research to measure outcomes for both the experimental (received coaching) and control (did not receive coaching) groups.
De Meuse et al (2009) conducted the first known meta-analysis on executive coaching outcomes that included randomised control trial studies, however the authors were only able to acquire six suitable papers and subsequently included other, non-randomised control trial studies in their meta-analysis. Despite the paucity of the studies, the authors found that overall coaching had a positive effect, which was strengthened when tied to specific objectives. Later Theeboom et al (2014) produced a meta-analysis that included

eight control studies focusing on quantitative data for outcomes; however these papers included post-test only measures (e.g., Poepsel, 2011). Theeboom et al (2014) established that studies utilising exclusively within-subjects designs reported considerably stronger effect sizes than the studies that included control groups, which suggested that research using a within-subjects methodology may be over estimating the effect of coaching. Theeboom et al (2014) also noted the shortage of rigorous studies available.
The Present Study
The purpose of the present thesis is to critically evaluate and review the existing research on the effectiveness of coaching through a meta-analysis of rigorous randomised control trials. Previous systematic analyses on coaching have called for larger samples of rigorous research (De Meuse et al., 2009) or further investigation into what makes coaching effective (Theeboom et al., 2014). The following questions will be addressed: Q1: Which outcomes are most affected by coaching? Q2: What factors influence (or moderate) the effect of coaching?
It has been suggested that certain age groups face specific challenges in life that may change the coaching process (Green et al., 2007), therefore age will also be examined as it may potentially moderate the effectiveness of coaching. This study will add to the existing literature and previous meta-analytical reviews (De Meuse et al., 2009; Theeboom et al., 2014) by: 1) including only randomised control studies with pre-test and post-test data for control and experimental groups; 2) taking the methodological quality of the primary studies into account; 3) including recent studies published after the most recent meta-analysis (2012 – 2014); 4) including unpublished dissertations that meet the selection criteria; and 5) applying clear inclusion criteria for the type of interventions and study design.
Method
A literature search was carried out using PsychINFO, Google Scholar, and Proquest databases to identify relevant studies published up to June 30, 2014. The following terms were used in the search: “executive coaching randomised control”, with additional terms “thesis” or “dissertation” used to refine the search. In addition to the term “executive”, similar coaching related labels “leadership”, “developmental”, “business”, and “life” were included. The terms “outcome” and “effect” were used to target quantitative studies. This search strategy yielded a total of 1,055 articles. The studies cited in previous reviews and meta-analyses (i.e., De Meuse et al., 2009; Grant, Passmore et al, 2010; Greif, 2007; Theeboom et al., 2014) were cross-checked and included if relevant.
Leading coaching academics were contacted via email in search of soon to be released publications that could be included in this study. This search strategy did not yield any relevant articles. Details on how many studies were removed at each stage can be found in Table 1.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Studies eligible for inclusion were screened in two phases. To pass the first stage of screening, studies were required to have a title and abstract which suggested that pre-test, post-test, and control measures were taken. In the second stage, studies were assessed based on a review of the complete article. The inclusion criteria were as follows: • sufficient statistics were reported in the article to enable calculation of standardised effect sizes, such as pre-test and post-test means, standard deviation, group sample size, and alpha coefficients; • the study needed to be a randomised control trial; • at least one self-reported or objective outcome measure was reported, such as well-being, depression, goal attainment, or self-rated job performance; • a coaching method design equivalent to Grant’s (2003) definition was used:
“...a collaborative solution focused, result-orientated and systematic process in which the coach facilitates the enhancement of life experience and goal attainment in the personal and/or professional life of normal, nonclinical clients” (p. 254);
• the coaching intervention was at least partially completed in a one-to-one setting, with an external coach.

To avoid duplication of data, theses that were eventually published were included as the published article. However, if the thesis had additional results, the data from the thesis were included instead (e.g., Green, 2004; Spence, 2006).
Calculating Effect Size
In a meta-analysis the effect sizes from measured outcomes in different studies are converted into a standardised effect size that is no longer positioned on the original measurement scale and can therefore be compared with outcomes from other scales.
The present meta-analysis calculated effect sizes using a method recommended by Hoffman and Smits (2008). In order to standardise the data across each randomised control trial, the mean difference between the pre-test and post-test measures was calculated for the experimental and the control groups. This was used to calculate the Hedges’ g effect size and its 95% confidence interval. This effect size is a variation on Cohen’s d that corrects for biases due to small sample sizes (Hedges & Olkin, 1985) and is calculated using the following formula:
In the equation above, is the mean pre- to post-test change, SD is the standard deviation of post-test scores, n is the sample size, experimental refers to the experimental condition, and control refers to the control condition.
According to Hedges (2008), the standardised mean difference and related effect sizes such as those found in the studies included in this meta-analysis are normally examined by calculating the change in means on a particular dependent variable either from pre- to post-test or between the experimental and control group (both at post-test). As a preference, generalised eta squared would have been calculated as it can be used for more than two sets of observations to compare changes both within-groups and between-groups (Lakens, 2013). However the data required to calculate this was not provided in most studies. Previous meta-analyses have focused on post-test only comparisons of the experimental and control group (Theeboom et al., 2014). Our approach was deemed more representative of true effect size as it took into account the between-subjects (i.e., experimental versus control), and within-subjects (i.e., pre-test versus post-test) differences. Importantly it takes into account how people change as a result of coaching rather than just looking at where they end up after the coaching.
Whether an effect size is considered small or large is open to interpretation. According to Cohen (1988), descriptions include approximations around small (d = 0.2), medium (d = 0.5), and large (d = 0.8). However in the context of a random effects model for meta-analysis, estimations of confidence limits for the overall mean effect are used to explain the effect size (Schmidt & Hunter, 1995). Meta-analytic Procedure and Statistical Analyses

MIX 2.0 - Professional software for meta-analysis in Excel was used to perform the meta-analysis. This application was chosen from a systematic comparison of software dedicated to meta-analysis, where MIX scored highest on the overall usability when compared to four other prominent software packages, as well as featuring the relevant analytical feature comparison of weighting according to alpha coefficients, confidence intervals and small study effect corrections (Bax, Yu, Ikeda, & Moons, 2007).
Similar to Theeboom et al (2014), the overall weighted effect size for the metaanalysis was calculated using the Hedges and Olkin (1985) method. Meta-analysis specialists generally regard the Hedges and Olkin random effects method as the most conservative approach as it corrects for sample size, measurement error and range restriction by removing the ability to inflate effect size estimates, manipulate statistical corrections for artifactual variance sources such as measurement error and restriction of range (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2011). As recommended by Borenstein et al (2011) the more conservative random-effect model was adopted for the meta-analysis. Compared to the fixed effect model, the random-effect approach permits that the true effect size differs from study to study based on both the variability of the independent variable, such as intensity or duration of intervention, and differences in the samples of the research population such as gender, age, and coaching experience (Borenstein et al., 2011; Hedges, 1994). This approach is generally considered best practice and recommended by Field (2001). The overall weighted mean effect size for all included studies will be represented by p̂ , while g will represent the weighted effect sizes of individual studies. From the studies included in this paper there were some cases where reliability values were not reported for the dependent variables. For these cases the alpha coefficients reported in the initial testing of these instruments were utilised. Where a range was provided the median was taken, e.g., if alpha coefficients ranged from 0.80-0.92, an alpha of 0.86 was employed.
Moderator Analyses
As recommended by Higgins and Thompson (2002), heterogeneity between studies was measured by calculating both the classical Q statistic and the I2 statistic. The most commonly used homogeneity statistic is Cochran’s Q (Cochran, 1954), which calculates a weighted sum of the square distances of the observed effects from the null hypothesis of equality of the effects. The Q statistic provided a significance test for between-study heterogeneity, whereas the value for I2 represented the percentage of between-study variance in effect sizes that can be attributed to between-study heterogeneity rather than within-study variability (Borenstein et al., 2011). Moderating variables were investigated using subgroup analyses for sets of studies that differed in terms of the study, author(s), age of participants, published and unpublished data, and outcome variables. Moderating variables are considered to be present when the value for I2 is above or close to 50 percent (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). The included studies and measures are presented in Table 2.

The random effects meta-analysis of executive coaching against control groups yielded an overall weighted effect size for all outcomes that was in the small to medium range, reflecting an advantage of coaching over control groups, p̂ = 0.42, 95% CI, 0.35 0.50, p <0.001, as presented in Table 3. The homogeneity in effect sizes was not statistically significant although moderate in scale, Q = 126.95; p = 0.081; I2 = 16.50. According to Higgins and Thompson (2002), variance of this magnitude does not warrant examination of moderator variables. However, given the exploratory nature of this study, further investigation of moderators took place.

Within-Subjects Mean Difference
Table 4 contains the within-subjects effect sizes for the experimental and control groups. Overall, there was a significant positive change across the experimental groups, p̂ = 0.40, 95% CI, 0.32 – 0.48, p < 0.001, whereas the control groups did not change beyond reasonable doubt, p̂ = 0.04, 95% CI, -0.03 – 0.10, p = 0.281.
The confidence intervals for the experimental group did not overlap with control group. According to Higgins and Thompson (2002) this result indicates that the effect was greater within the experimental group.

2012; O’Connor & Cavanagh, 2012; Richardson, 2010; Spence & Grant, 2007), which indicated that the effect was weak and could potentially be 0.00 (Schmidt & Hunter, 1995). The Effect of Coachee Age on the Outcome Variables
As a range of ages were noted throughout the studies, the average age from each study was investigated as a potential moderator. Participants in studies with an average age younger than 30 years, g = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.36 – 0.57, p < 0.001, were slightly more receptive to coaching than those studies with an average age of 30 years and older, g = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.26 – 0.48, p < 0.001. Both groups responded positively to the intervention, and a t-test revealed that there was no significant difference between the two groups, t(100) = 0.31, p = 0.758. While the age group 30 years and above did yield a significant homogeneity statistic, the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that is due to heterogeneity between studies was below the recommended threshold (Higgins & Thompson, 2002), Q = 60.66; p = 0.025; I2 = 32.41%.

Effect Sizes per Outcome Category
Table 6 displays the results for all outcome categories: attitudes, coping, performance, self-regulation, and well-being. Attitudes, g = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.54 - 1.03, p < 0.001, coping, g = 0.68, 95% CI, 0.33-1.03, p < 0.001, self-regulation, g = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.30 - 0.56, p < 0.001, and well-being, g = 0.41, 95% CI, 0.31 - 0.50, p < 0.001, were all found to be positively influenced by coaching. These results suggest that coaching interventions have significant positive effects on all outcome categories. It is important to note that only one study (Bozer & Sarros, 2012) included performance-related ratings which comprised of self-rated and observer-rated measures. While other authors did include performance ratings, these measures were not assessed for internal consistency and therefore could not be included in this analysis. Measures that did not have an alpha coefficient were omitted, for example, Spence and Grant’s (2007) use of Goal Attainment Scaling was not included as there was no alpha coefficient reported.

Table 7 contains the measures used to determine the outcomes. The results suggest that overall workplace specific well-being improves following the coaching intervention. The greatest improvement was found in Test Attitude Inventory, g = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.42 1.49, p < 0.001, while the smallest effect size with confidence intervals overlapping zero was found in the Positive Affect Scale, g = 0.35, 95% CI, -0.24 – 0.94, p = 0.244. These results will be further reflected upon in the discussion section.

Publication Bias
As illustrated in Figure 1, there were no noticeable signs of publication bias. Furthermore a sub-group analysis of the post-test outcomes revealed that unpublished theses, g = 0.39, 95% CI, 0.28 – 0.50, p < 0.001, returned very similar results to published articles, g = 0.41, 95% CI, 0.28 – 0.53, p < 0.001. However it should be noted that some of the theses were eventually published within peer-reviewed journals.

Discussion
The current literature on coaching supports its efficacy in improving workplace performance and well-being. Prevailing meta-analyses have focused on using either quasiexperimental field study data or exclusively post-test outcomes to determine overall effect sizes (see De Meuse et al., 2009; Theeboom et al., 2014). The findings from these analyses do not take into account the control group’s outcomes, nor the differences between the control group and experimental group’s pre-test scores.

to include solely randomised control trial (RCT) studies removed some of these methodological issues and provides a more accurate picture of the effects of coaching. The purpose of the present thesis was to critically evaluate and systematically review the existing research on the effectiveness of coaching and reach a conclusion through the use of meta-analysis. Associations between the coaching intervention and multiple types of outcomes were investigated using best practice methodology (i.e., exclusively RCT studies). The results show that coaching has a moderate positive effect on well-being, work-related attitude, coping strategies, and self-directed goal attainment. In summary, the meta-analysis revealed that coaching is an effective tool for improving individuals’ perception about themselves and their workplace. In practice, individuals with improved well-being will provide the organisation they work for with a positive outcome, however coaching assignments are taken on with the intention of developing specific competencies to improve performance, not just well-being.
The overall effect size findings of the current research were considerably more conservative than recent meta-analyses that reported a medium to strong effect size overall (Theeboom et al., 2014) and a very strong effect size (De Meuse et al., 2009). The notable difference in effect size between the current study and previous meta-analyses can be attributed to the difference in methodology. For example, unlike Theeboom et al (2014) who only included post-test data, the current study controlled for pre-test data in the analysis. Including both pre-test and post-test data allows for the assessment of change in measures resulting from the intervention as it accounts for the differences between the control and experimental groups prior to, as well as after, the intervention. Another factor giving rise to the difference in effect could be sample size. For instance, ever since De Meuse et al (2009) first raised the issue of the scarcity of robust data, the effect of coaching on outcomes as a topic of research has grown in popularity. Such progress is apparent in the increase in RCT studies available, growing from four available papers in 2009 to the eleven included in this study.
The investigation into coachee age revealed that younger participants had slightly stronger outcomes in contrast to their older peers, however not to a level that warranted further investigation.
A between-measures moderator analysis was conducted to further expand on previous research into coaching outcomes. The largest effect was found in the Test Attitudes Questionnaire (Spielberger, 1980), which measures an individual’s anxiety in relation to a test. All other measures included within the study only showed a moderate improvement or less. Remarkably, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) did not perform nearly as consistently as similar measures like the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Although moderately correlated (Crawford & Henry, 2004), these two scales returned noticeably different results, which demonstrates the importance of choosing the right psychological measure for the situation. These findings reiterate how crucial it is to have trained/accredited psychologists’ input when assessing change in coachee behaviour. For this reason it is critical to coaching’s pursuit of being considered a profession that at least some psychological contribution be considered when designing coaching solutions.

Limitations
Although many of the methodological problems of meta-analytic studies were avoided, there remained some notable weaknesses to the current study. The first limitation was that one research group related to the University of Sydney (e.g., Grant, Green, & Rynsaardt, 2010) published seven of the eleven theses and articles included herein. Their involvement in over 50 per cent of the studies could perhaps be deemed as having too much influence over the outcomes of the meta-analysis. However the fact that studies from this group were within the outcome range of the others suggest that no bias was present.
Secondly, coaching interventions and outcomes across the included studies varied greatly, which limited the amount of direct comparisons that could be made for a metaanalytic synthesis. Furthermore, employing strict selection criteria resulted in a relatively small number of studies included in the final analysis. Although there was no evidence for publication bias and the inclusion of eleven studies was above the minimum of two for meta-analysis (Sterne, Egger, & Moher, 2008), further research is still required to substantiate these results.
Future Research
The findings of the current study could be used by coaches to form balanced and honest advice to their clients about the accurate and reliable benefits of coaching. More rigorous research designs (featuring randomisation to a control group) are needed to support coaching as an evidenced based profession. As Grant, Passmore et al (2010) discussed in a review of the coaching literature, there is a strong emphasis on descriptive studies that investigate practice-related issues as opposed to proving the effectiveness of the coaching intervention. It is broadly understood that the research design with the highest methodological rigor is an RCT (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). While within-subject studies remain helpful when focusing on the complexities of the coach-coachee relationship there is now strong cause for evidence-based practice to set the standard for coaches. A coach’s guidance can only account for a finite amount of coachee improvement. If researchers employ within-subjects research methods, a leader’s experience, values, special talents and interests are not adequately accounted for. To consider the effectiveness of coaching in the wider context of the whole person, RCTs represent the best technique to measure the effect of coaching on leadership functioning. Combining the RCT design with taking pre-test, post-test measures allows researchers to control for a range of threats to internal and external validity such as unrelated organisational financial gains or mental health issues (Grant, 2009; Grant, 2012).
A recent inclusion on the list of measurable coaching outcomes is Return On Investment (ROI), which involves the coachee examining organisational results and making a judgement call as to how much of the improvement can be attributed to the coaching (McGovern et al., 2001). Many researchers have argued against the use of ROI, given the highly subjective figure being thrust into a formula that ignores many other variables (see De Meuse et al., 2009; Grant, 2012). While it is understandable that those involved in the change sequence should be the closest and most knowledgeable about where their bottom line is affected and how, this form of measurement lacks objectivity. However from the client’s point of view, suggesting a potential ROI is often the difference between gaining

Page 20
approval for the coaching project or not. While ROI may not be the most scientific approach to examining effectiveness, practitioner’s find it a very useful tool for “proving” their worth to organisations (Parker-Wilkins, 2006). However, ROI is an exceptionally subjective outcome that carries with it a wide range of reliability and validity issues (De Meuse et al., 2009; Grant, 2012). There has been some conjecture amongst researchers around the appropriateness of linking company profits to coaching outcomes (Grant, 2012). The risk of doing so is that coaches will make promises to clients about the outcomes of coaching based on inaccurate data, resulting in damage to its credibility in the market. Therefore objective key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to the individual are recommended. Typically, when individuals rate their performance they tend to overestimate their value in comparison to observer’s ratings and concrete data (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960), therefore when measuring performance outcomes objective measures should be taken. This also highlights the need for more performance rating in the coaching literature, as the majority of tools used are related to well-being and self-regulation related topics such as depression, anxiety, and coping. Suggested measures that are relevant to the coach-coachee relationship as well as the organisation funding the program include for example KPIs, staff engagement, and employee turnover.
To further prove the true value of coaching, there is opportunity for researchers to follow the lead of Finn (2007) and Green (2004) by conducting longitudinal explorations. Although sparse, results so far have shown coaching has an incredibly positive, lasting impact on an individual. It should be no surprise that the benefits of coaching remain present with the coachee for months following the final session (Green et al., 2006; Green et al., 2007; Finn, 2007) as improved self-regulation is a key outcome of most coaching programs. Unfortunately, longitudinal studies to date have only measured experimental groups for the longitudinal component. By taking measures from the experimental and control groups over multiple time points, future researchers could extend these data to find some of the lasting impacts that coaching can have. For example, measuring engagement across teams and the wider organisation could provide insight into the top-down flow on effects of coaching and changes in group attitudes.
Conclusion
Overall, coaching resulted in a moderate positive effect for the outcomes included in this study. However the current meta-analysis revealed more about what was missing than what was present. There is a strong empirical claim that coaching improves the well-being of coachees, however the measures employed for performance are not currently meeting a satisfactory empirical standard. The practice of coaching stands to lose its considerable credibility in the commercial world if coaches cannot accurately demonstrate ROI that involves definitive improvements in coachee performance. Theeboom et al (2014) asked, ‘how does it work?’–clearly it can be argued that coaching improves the well-being of the coachee, which in turn is seen as favourable by the organisation. However the question to be asked now is, ‘what is the value?’ more specifically, ‘how do we measure the value?’ Current research around return on investment from a commercial point of view is limited. Either psychologists need to become more commercial or coaches in general need to take on more statistical rigour to prove their worth to organisations.
