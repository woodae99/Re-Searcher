Introduction
This book takes several ideas from the so-called enactive approach devel
oped in cognitive science and philosophy of mind over the last twenty
years or so and applies them specifically to the field of affective science.
The result is both a further development of the enactive approach itself,
by extending it to a further domain of inquiry, and a reconceptualization
of various affective phenomena as they appear in affective science that, I
think, does more justice to their complexity.
Affective science, to be sure, is not a field with clear boundaries. Like its
close relative cognitive science, it is a research area in which multiple dis
ciplines study a common object of interest—which in this case is “affect”
or “affectivity,” broadly understood to include related phenomena such as
emotions, feelings, moods, and mood disorders. In a liberal interpretation,
any theory or study that explores these phenomena can be seen as contrib
uting to affective science. Not only psychology and neuroscience, then,
but history, anthropology, ethology, sociology, computer science, political
science, education, literature, and philosophy—just to mention some, and
in no particular order—can be seen as disciplines making up the field. The
more these disciplines cross-fertilize, the better are our chances of gaining
an accurate understanding of affectivity, and thus of ourselves (as well as
of other creatures). In this work, however, I focus primarily on the two dis
ciplines that arguably have the most prominent role in the field, namely,
experimental psychology and neuroscience. My goal is to bring a variety
of “enactivist” ideas to bear on these two disciplines, in different ways. I
see enactivism as a highly suitable framework for an account of affectivity
that characterizes it as an essential dimension of the mind, as well as a rich
source of ideas for how to conceptualize and study a variety of affective
phenomena.


xiv Introduction
What, however, is enactivism? There are now various accounts that call
themselves “enactive.” The version of enactivism on which I draw in this
book is the one originally articulated by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch (1991)
and further elaborated more recently by Thompson (2007, 2011a, 2011b),
as well as others (see, e.g., the collection of papers in Stewart, Gapenne, and
Di Paolo 2010). It is a complex tapestry of several interrelated and mutu
ally supporting ideas from different fields of inquiry, notably cognitive sci
ence, biology, and the philosophical tradition of phenomenology. As such,
it is not a radically novel framework but a synthesis of various ideas (some
older, some newer), one that keeps evolving by incorporating new empiri
cal studies and theoretical perspectives. Enactivism explicitly traces its
sources to various phenomenological and existential philosophies. Varela,
Thompson, and Rosch (1991, xv) presented their approach specifically as
a continuation of Merleau-Ponty’s work, and further “phenomenological
connections” (especially with Merleau-Ponty and Husserl, but not only) are
discussed in more detail by Thompson (2007). Other important affinities
can be found, for example, in the pragmatism of James and Dewey, Gestalt
psychology, the cybernetic movement of the 1940s and 1950s, and ecologi
cal psychology (see also Di Paolo, Rohde, and De Jaegher 2010).
Because of this complexity, it is not easy to characterize the enactive
approach briefly, and one always runs the risk of overlooking some impor
tant features. For the purposes of this introduction, I outline only some
of enactivism’s major ideas and themes, leaving the illustration of more
specific points to individual chapters. I should also emphasize that I do
not address all facets of the enactive approach in this book. Rather, I pull
out from its tapestry those threads that I think are more relevant for affec
tive science, and weave them further. For now I limit myself to the most
visible strands and mention why I think they are promising for a study of
affectivity.
One of the central ideas of enactivism is embodiment. According to it,
the mind is not an immaterial Cartesian substance, a thinking thing, but
neither (and more controversially) is the brain its minimally sufficient
physical basis. Rather, the mind is enacted or brought forth by the living
organism in virtue of its specific organization and its interaction with the
world. Particularly significant for present purposes is that the body, in the
enactive approach, is not just a sensorimotor system, namely, a physical
system that links sensory inputs and motor actions. Enactivism impor
tantly also emphasizes the wetter and bloodier self-regulatory dimension


Introduction xv
of embodiment, which includes the biochemical activity of metabolism,
and more generally homeostatic (or better, homeodynamic) processes. The
body of the enactive mind is thus not just the perceiving and acting body
but the living body, and as such it includes, for example, the viscera, the
circulatory system, the immune system, and the endocrine system. These
dimensions of the body are all seen as contributing to the kind of mind
one has (although, as I explain later, even unicellular organisms can be
said to have a mind from the enactive perspective). Such a comprehensive
notion of the body is especially relevant for a study of affectivity. In every
day life, affective phenomena such as emotions and moods come with a
variety of bodily experiences, and others’ bodily posture and facial expres
sions undoubtedly play a part in how we understand them when we are in
their presence. Affective science has been confirming that several changes
take place in expression, autonomic nervous system activity, and muscular
tension when people undergo an emotion or are in a specific mood. So not
only would it be restrictive to constrain the study of affective phenomena
to the brain only (or even to claim that they are just brain processes), but
a conception of the body that limits it to a sensorimotor system does not
suffice for an account of these phenomena, either.1
Another central idea of the enactive approach is that the scientific study
of the mind cannot ignore lived experience; rather, it has to take it seriously
and develop adequate methods for its investigation. Adopting an enactive
approach thus entails paying special attention to, and developing accurate
descriptions of, this dimension of the mind. This is why Varela, Thompson,
and Rosch (1991) engaged not just with the Western philosophical tradi
tion of phenomenology but also with the Buddhist tradition of mindful
ness meditation, which offers accounts of experience but also techniques
for the first-person exploration of consciousness. This concern with lived
experience is another feature of the enactive approach that I find particu
larly appealing for a study of affective phenomena. Emotions and moods
can be complex experiences and as such deserve to be addressed with ade
quate descriptive and analytical tools. Enactivism provides such tools via its
phenomenological connections and encourages the development of new
ones. Compared to the study of the organism in its many physical (or bet
ter, living) aspects, the one of lived experience is much less advanced in
affective science. So as part of taking an enactive perspective, I often call
for more attention to this dimension and develop some phenomenological
considerations myself.


xvi Introduction
Importantly, the enactive approach is not just interested in lived experi
ence per se but maintains that phenomenological analyses should be part
and parcel of the experimental investigation of the mind. The study of
the organism as a living system and the study of the organism as a subject
of experience are not independent but need each other and should aim
to complement each other productively. More specifically, the scientific
inquiry needs adequate descriptions of lived experience to make sense of
brain and bodily activity; conversely, the study of the living organism can
help to refine accounts of lived experience. This idea, as we shall see in
more detail later in the book, fits broadly with recent attempts to “natural
ize phenomenology,” although it does not aim to reduce lived experience
to descriptions of physical processes. In line with this enactivist theme, in
the course of the book I often use phenomenological and empirical consid
erations about a variety of affective phenomena to support and illuminate
one another (in addition to dedicating a whole chapter to the suggestion
of augmenting current affective neuroscience with first- and second-person
methods for the study of lived experience).
These ideas are related to the most radical-sounding theme of the enac
tive approach (one that can be traced to the philosophy of the organism
of Hans Jonas, and to some extent further back to Aristotle), namely, the
so-called thesis of the deep continuity of life and mind. Thompson (2007, ix)
introduces it from the beginning as the main subject of his book, phras
ing it as follows: “The organizational properties distinctive of mind are an
enriched version of those fundamental to life” (see also Thompson 2011a).
This formulation should not be read as implying that there are forms of life
not rich enough to be “minded.” Life, for the enactive approach, is in fact
sufficient for mind (as we shall see in more detail in chapter 1). The thesis
is then that the organizational properties of life are sufficient for mind,
and enriched forms of mind are an enriched version of them. Mind did
not appear at some point in evolution in a specific life-form but reaches
down to the simplest organisms. Life is thus always “minded” or “mind
ful,” and the richer a living form, the richer its mind. Importantly, the deep
life-mind continuity thesis also entails that even in its richest forms, mind
remains “life-like.” Mind shares the organizational properties of life, and to
understand the organizational properties of life is thus to make consider
able progress toward understanding the mind as well.
This thesis is more than just another theme in the enactive approach; it
is in fact what holds its many threads together—what grounds and justifies


Introduction xvii
its ambitious striving for a synthesis of biological, neuroscientific, psycho
logical, and phenomenological ideas, as well as its emphasis on self-orga
nization, mutual influences and temporality, deep brain-body integration,
bodily experience, and more (all topics to which I return in the course of
the book). It also entails a very different conception of cognition from what
is generally assumed in cognitive, as well as affective, science. The enactive
conception, as I argue in the first chapter, importantly entails that cognition
is, necessarily, always already affective (in a sense that I specify). So although
in this book I end up discussing primarily the emotions (and, occasion
ally, moods) of the affective scientist, it is important to bear in mind that
the enactive approach entails that there is no difference in kind between
cognition and emotion. Rather, both cognition and emotion turn out to
be instances of the relentless sense-making activity of the precarious living
organism as it maintains itself via continuous processes of self-regulation
and exchange with the environment. Sense making, as we shall see, is a cen
tral notion in the enactive approach, and I present it toward the beginning
of the book to provide an overarching frame to the rest of the discussion.
The rest of the book otherwise focuses, primarily at least, on the more
mundane phenomena that traditionally occupy the psychologists and neu
roscientists of emotion—such as basic emotions, appraisals, bodily arousal,
bodily feelings, emotion experience, and more. Sometimes I criticize how
these phenomena are characterized in affective science; other times I pro
pose alternative conceptualizations that are variously inspired by the enac
tive approach. Importantly, then, the aim of this work is not so much to
defend the enactive approach by developing new arguments in addition
to those already advanced in the relevant literature. Rather, I aim to bring
enactive ideas to bear on a further set of phenomena that until now have
been relatively neglected by enactivism itself, as well as more generally by
the so-called embodied-embedded approach in the philosophy of cognitive
science.2
Some readers will be unsympathetic to the enactive approach to start
with and will thus want to question the very premises of some (if not all)
of my arguments. But many of the ideas of this book can be taken on board
even by those who do not endorse the whole enactivist package. Given the
many themes that make up enactivism, I believe that, different worldviews
notwithstanding, even the non- or anti-enactivist reader can find value in
some of the specific ideas that I advance. Also, some of the lines I develop
(e.g., the critique of basic emotions, the analyses of emotion experience,


xviii Introduction
the discussion of empathy and mimicry) do not require taking any stance
toward enactivism altogether. My main concern is first of all with affectiv
ity and emotion, and I think of the enactive approach as a most suitable
tool for what I want to say about them, as well as a rich source of ideas
and inspiration for further elaborations. I have not found the same degree
of intellectual affinity and the same resources in other frameworks. Yet
if some readers will find independent value in some of the specific ideas
about affectivity and emotion on offer, I shall not think my efforts have
been in vain.


1 Primordial Affectivity
1.1 Reclaiming a Broader and Deeper Notion of Affectivity
Affective scientists, as their name implies, study affective phenomena. As
we shall appreciate in more detail as the book unfolds, they focus especially
on emotion, understood as a psychological faculty of its own, distinct from
but also importantly linked to other faculties, such as perception, attention,
memory, and so on. This emotional faculty manifests itself in a variety of
different and primarily short-lived emotions—sadness, fear, happiness, guilt,
pride, shame, and many others. Affective scientists also (although more
rarely) study moods, which they see as differing from emotions mainly in
intensity and duration, in particular as being less intense and longer lasting
than emotions.1
I discuss several affective-scientific approaches in this book; however,
the aim of this initial chapter is to emphasize that emotions and moods do
not exhaust the realm of affectivity.2 The emotions and moods of the affec
tive scientist are usually temporary episodes that take place in an otherwise
affect-free mind. They are, in other words, mere contingent happenings
of the mind. Even when moods, unlike emotions, are (sometimes) said to
be always present, they remain “surface” phenomena that could be taken
away from the mind, while the mind would still be such. Affectivity as
I understand it and discuss it in this chapter goes beyond such fleeting
events: it is a broader phenomenon that permeates the mind, necessarily
and not merely contingently. The mind, as embodied, is intrinsically or
constitutively affective; you cannot take affectivity away from it and still
have a mind. Affectivity as discussed in this chapter refers broadly to a lack
of indifference, and rather a sensibility or interest for one’s existence. The ety
mology of the term already points to this meaning: “affectivity” refers to


2 Chapter 1
the capacity or possibility to be “done something,” to be “struck” or “influ
enced” (the term comes from the past participle of the Latin verb afficio,
“to strike, to influence”—itself a compound of ad, “to,” and facio, “to do”).
This influence is not merely physical or mechanical (as when one says that
the daily amount of sunlight affects the air temperature) but psychologi
cal. It refers to the capacity to be personally affected, to be “touched” in
a meaningful way by what is affecting one. In this broad sense, it is not
necessary to be in a specific emotion or mood to be in an affective state;
one is affected when something merely strikes one as meaningful, relevant,
or salient.
Drawing on the enactive approach, in this chapter I argue that affectivity
thus understood depends on the organizational properties of life, such that
all living systems—even the simplest ones—are affective; hence the term
primordial affectivity. As we will see in detail later, according to the enactive
approach, all living systems are sense-making systems, namely (and roughly
for now), they inhabit a world that is significant for them, a world that they
themselves enact or bring forth as the correlate of their needs and concerns.
In the enactive approach, this activity of sense making is the mark of cogni
tion. What I add to this idea is the point that the activity of sense making
is simultaneously also affective. To clarify, the claim is not that all living
systems, including the simplest ones, have emotions. The claim is rather
that even the simplest living systems have a capacity to be sensitive to what
matters to them, and in this sense they are affective. Nor is the claim that
even the simplest living systems are conscious; rather, the simplest living
systems already realize a relationship with themselves and the world in
which they are situated that entails purposefulness and concern for their
existence. But such purposefulness and concern need not be accompanied
by consciousness; rather, they ought to be understood as properties of a
specific organization that sets up an asymmetry between the living system
and the rest of the world, which consists in a perspective or point of view
from which the world acquires meaning. Once embedded in more complex
organisms, this perspective will also (at some point, although when and
how is not the present concern) exhibit awareness.
Affectivity thus characterized is not just broader but “deeper” than the
emotions and moods of affective science, in the sense that it grounds them
or makes them possible; in other words, without the primordial capacity to
be affected, no specific emotions and moods would appear. The idea that


Primordial Affectivity 3
affectivity is a broader and deeper phenomenon than distinct emotions or
even moods can be found in various works in the philosophical tradition
of phenomenology, but also before them. In the first part of this chapter, I
introduce and discuss some of these works. I begin with Spinoza’s notion of
the conatus, which grounds all the emotions in a conative or motivational
dimension of existence. I then move on to the notion of the lived body,
as introduced in particular by Maine de Biran, who especially emphasized
the active and effortful character of bodily subjectivity, arguably provid
ing a phenomenological account of the conative dimension of existence. I
also address Michel Henry’s discussion of Maine de Biran, which endorses
his characterization of the lived body while also making room in it for
a dimension of passivity; passivity, for Henry, is required if we want to
include affectivity in the sphere of bodily subjectivity. In addition, Henry
himself points to an even deeper dimension of bodily subjectivity, which
straddles the active–passive distinction and is arguably itself “affective” in
the broad sense of sensitive and nonindifferent. I then consider Heidegger’s
conception of moods, which, unlike the moods of the affective scientist,
are noncontingent, inescapable modes of existing that allow the world to
matter in various ways. Finally I turn to Patočka’s appropriation, as well
as criticism, of Heidegger’s treatment of moods, which links them back to
Maine de Biran’s notion of the lived body and sees them as manifestations
of how the world impinges “physiognomically” on the bodily subject.
This historical overview will be brief. It is not meant to be exhaustive
and to engage with scholarly debates; its more modest aim is to begin trac
ing the philosophical lineage of a notion of affectivity that is rarely if ever
acknowledged in current scientific as well as philosophical accounts of
emotion and mood (and one that could be traced in many more works).3
With the exception of Heidegger, none of the philosophers I have men
tioned feature, for example, in the recent seven-hundred-page Oxford Hand
book of Philosophy of Emotion (Goldie 2010). In addition, the views I have
chosen refer explicitly to the body (again with the exception of Heidegger,
as discussed hereafter) and will thus allow me to clarify the sense in which
primordial affectivity is a dimension of embodiment.
After this historical premise, I turn properly to the enactive approach, in
particular to the notion of sense making as elaborated in recent discussions.
I explain why this notion entails that all living systems are not only cog
nitive but also affective.4 I also explain in which sense this notion can be


4 Chapter 1
seen as grounding the emotions of more complex organisms. Finally I turn
to affective science itself, to qualify the claim that it relies on a relatively
narrow and shallow notion of affectivity. As we shall see, there are excep
tions to this claim. Some scientific accounts deviate from the mainstream
approach and identify affective phenomena that go beyond emotions and
moods and are intimately related with embodied existence. Such affective
phenomena have various features in common with my notion of primor
dial affectivity; however, they still fall short of it in some respect or another,
which will be useful to elucidate.
1.2 Spinoza’s Conatus: Striving as the Ground of All Affects
Spinoza in his Ethics developed a rich account of the emotions (“affects”
in his terminology) while also acknowledging a deeper conative or motiva
tional dimension of existence. He maintained that all existence is intrinsi
cally striving, that the “essence of everything,” including nonliving things,
is a conatus—an effort or endeavor to persevere in its being (see III.6 and
III.7).5 It was quite common in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century phi
losophy to employ the term “conatus” to refer to a thing’s effort or striving
toward what is advantageous for it. Spinoza himself had been influenced by
Hobbes, who in Leviathan discussed an analogous phenomenon, claiming
that all finite beings are driven by “a perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power
after power” (Hobbes [1651] 1991, 70).
Spinoza’s philosophy rejects several aspects of Cartesianism, including
the idea that body (matter, extension) and mind (soul, thought) are two
separate substances that interact causally at the level of the pineal gland.6
Spinoza famously criticized this interactionist view, arguing that the mind,
as an immaterial substance without extension and thus without surfaces,
cannot causally affect and be affected by the material substance that is the
body. He held instead that mind and body are two of the infinite attributes
of the same divine Substance, God, which is also none other than Nature.
These two attributes alone are known to us and constitute our nature. In
human beings, the conatus thus has a mental and a bodily expression and
as such is called “appetite” (appetitus). “Desire” (cupiditas) refers in particu
lar to awareness or consciousness of one’s appetite, but otherwise “there is
no difference between appetite and desire” (III.9). Importantly, in Spinoza’s
ontology the two realms of body and mind are causally closed systems:


Primordial Affectivity 5
every bodily event follows from a bodily event, and every mental event fol
lows from a mental event. Bodily and mental events thus do not interact
causally; there is, however, a “parallelism” between them: “The order and
connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things”
(II.7). Every bodily event corresponds to a mental one; they are different
expressions or modes of the same substance: “A mode of extension and
the idea of that mode are one and the same thing expressed in two differ
ent ways” (II.7). Human behavior is thus not caused by mental activity;
rather, it is the manifestation of the unfolding of the appetite, itself an
aspect of the changing nature of God-Nature as it unfolds in its striving
self-affirmation.7
One consequence of this view is that, as Spinoza explicitly pointed out,
we do not first evaluate things and situations as good and desirable for
us and subsequently strive for them; rather, it is our fundamental striving
nature that determines what counts as good or bad for us: “We neither
strive for, wish, seek, nor desire anything because we think it to be good,
but, on the contrary, we adjudge a thing to be good because we strive for,
wish, seek, or desire it” (III.9). This claim constitutes a reversal of the current
widespread position according to which evaluations bring about desires
and emotions (see chap. 4). As we shall see, this reversal is very much in
line with the enactive approach, according to which what counts as good or
bad for an organism is not detected by a disembodied cognitive-evaluative
faculty; rather, it is the intrinsically purposive nature of the organism that
enacts or brings forth what matters for its continuation.
Spinoza’s characterization of the conatus is followed by an account
of, in his terminology, the “affects,” namely, “the affections of the body,
by which the power of acting of the body itself is increased, diminished,
helped, or hindered, together with the ideas of these affections” (III, defini
tion 3). All affects spring from three “primary” ones, of which desire is one;
the other two are joy (laetitia) and sorrow (tristitia), defined as the passions
in which the mind (and the body with it) passes to a greater and lesser
perfection respectively (III.11). All the other affects derive from these three,
depending on the different “ideas” that accompany them.8 For example,
“Love is nothing but joy accompanied with the idea of an external cause,
and hatred is nothing but sorrow with the accompanying idea of an external
cause” (III.13); “Hope is nothing but unsteady joy, arising from the image of
a future or past thing about whose issue we doubt. Fear, on the other hand,


6 Chapter 1
is an unsteady sorrow, arising from the image of a doubtful thing” (III.18);
“commiseration ... we may define as sorrow which springs from another’s
loss. ... Love toward the person who has done good to another we shall call
favour ... , whilst hatred towards him who has done evil to another we shall
call indignation” (III.22).
Individual affects thus involve different “cognitions,” to put it in con
temporary terms. Spinoza’s theory of the affects has in fact been character
ized as cognitive by various commentators, which is accurate given that
for Spinoza cognitions (ideas, concepts) play an important role in distin
guishing different affects from one another. Yet far from being identified
uniquely with ideas or images, in Spinoza the individual affects remain
fundamentally appetitive, namely, based on the essentially conative nature
of everything, which in humans takes the form of appetite and desire.
Importantly, although Spinoza characterizes joy and sorrow as “primary,”
they themselves depend on the appetite; indeed, they are “species” of the
appetite. In III.57 Spinoza writes that “desire is the very nature or essence
of a person,” and after reminding us of his characterization of the primary
affects, he concludes that joy and sorrow are “indexes,” so to speak, of how
conducive external events are to one’s self-affirming existence: “Joy and
sorrow are passions by which the power of a person or his effort to perse
vere in his own being is increased or diminished, helped or limited. ... But
by the effort to persevere in his own being, in so far as it is related at the
same time to the mind and the body, we understand appetite and desire,
... and therefore joy and sorrow are desire or appetite in so far as the lat
ter is increased, diminished, helped, or limited by external causes.” Desire
(conscious appetite) is thus “more primary” than joy and sorrow; these two
affects would not be possible in a nonappetitive being. Because all other
affects depend on desire, joy, and sorrow, we can conclude that for Spinoza
they are all grounded in a primordial appetitive dimension.
This appetitive dimension is affective in the broad sense mentioned ear
lier: the striving being is not indifferent toward its own existence but rather
endeavors to maintain it; its perspective is thus not neutral but interested
and concerned. Moreover, the striving being needs to be open and sensi
tive to what is conducive to its continuation and what is not.9 Thus we can
see Spinoza’s conatus as a dimension of affectivity that runs deeper than
the affects. The affects are specific forms that this affective dimension takes
depending on the mental activity that accompanies it.


Primordial Affectivity 7
Importantly also, both the appetite and the affects in Spinoza’s account
remain thoroughly embodied. The appetite, as we saw, is the form that the
conatus takes in human beings, and has a bodily and a mental expression.
Likewise for the affects. Although they are characterized as differing from
one another in terms of the mental ideas they involve, they remain thor
oughly “psychosomatic” events, because any idea for Spinoza is always
accompanied by a specific mode of extension (that is, a bodily event).
1.3 Enter the Lived Body: From Maine de Biran’s Experience of Effort to
Henry’s “Interior Quivering”
Spinoza thus grounds the affects in a primordial affective dimension and
characterizes them as both mental and bodily. Yet something important
is missing from his account, namely, a description of how the appetite,
as well as the different affects, are also experienced as bodily. This is where
Spinoza arguably remains Cartesian. Although mind and body in the Eth
ics are not two separate substances, they are nevertheless distinct attributes
that can be conceived apart from each other. Now, Spinoza’s conception of
matter is quite unlike that of Descartes. As Hampshire (1951, 79–80) puts it,
Spinoza’s “was materialism with a difference, if only because the word ‘mat
ter’ normally suggests something solid and inert, and no such notion of
matter is to be found in his writings.” Spinoza’s matter, unlike Descartes’s
lifeless res extensa, is striving and self-maintaining; as an attribute of God
Nature, it is subject to the conatus and thus endeavors to persevere in its
being (see also Jonas 1965). Yet Spinoza never mentions how matter, when
instantiated as a human body, is experienced. Every change in the body
is also a change in the mind, but aside from this parallelism, the activ
ity of the body is not reflected or mirrored in consciousness. Instead the
body quickly disappears from Spinoza’s account of the emotions—not in
the sense that they become “disembodied” (every emotion is always at the
same time mental and bodily), but in the sense that they are analyzed solely
in terms of the various ideas that accompany them, with no reference to
bodily movements or bodily feelings.10
It is here that Spinoza remains Cartesian. Descartes, in his own account
of the emotions (elaborated in the last of his works published in his life
time, The Passions of the Soul [1649] 1989), characterized the emotions as
passions or perceptions caused by bodily movements whose effects are felt


8 Chapter 1
in the mind. Among other things, he spent considerable time providing
detailed descriptions of the different bodily changes causing the various
emotions. Even so, these bodily changes remained mere causal antecedents
of the emotions; they were not felt as part of the emotions (see also G. Hat
field 2007). The body in Descartes thus remained extrinsic to experience.
Similarly, even if for Spinoza the body is constitutive of the emotions, it
remains a silent, nonconscious material substrate. Neither in Descartes nor
in Spinoza, then, do we find an account of the body as lived or experi
enced. The body is either the extrinsic cause or the silent parallel accompa
niment of the mind. The emotions remain experientially disembodied in
both accounts.
For an account of the body as lived and not just as extended, we need
to turn to phenomenology. The notion of the lived body or, in German,
Leib—namely, the body as it is experienced in the first person—is usually
traced to Husserl’s discussion in the second volume of the Ideas (Husserl
[1952] 1989), where he distinguishes it from the notion of Körper, namely,
the body under a physical description.11 Merleau-Ponty is traditionally
introduced as the philosopher who made the most room for the lived
body in his phenomenology of perception (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 1962),
in particular with his discussion of “motor intentionality” and “corporeal
schema”—where the first notion refers to the body’s implicit relatedness to
the world, its concrete and practical “reaching out” to the world in its vari
ous activities, and the second, related notion refers to the implicit aware
ness I have of my body when orienting myself in the world.
Before Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, however, a less-known (at least in
Anglo-American philosophy) French philosopher, Maine de Biran (1766
1824), had already provided an account of the body as “subjective.”12
Merleau-Ponty, who lectured on Biran (see Merleau-Ponty [1968] 2001),
acknowledged (although with various qualifications) that he radically trans
formed the Cartesian cogito (thinking thing) by positing the body as neces
sary for it. Biran indeed rejected Descartes’s characterization of subjectivity
as a thinking substance separate from the body. For Biran, a proper analy
sis of consciousness reveals that subjectivity is given in experience, via an
“immediate apperception,” as a force manifested in effort and movement:
“Because I think, I understand, I want, I act, I perceive my effort, I know
that I act, I exist for myself as an individual force; therefore I am really and
absolutely an acting force” (Maine de Biran 1841, 18; my translation). That


Primordial Affectivity 9
I exist as bodily is entailed by this phenomenological fact; my corporeity is
immediately given to me in the effortful experience I have of myself as an
acting force. Importantly, this experience of myself as a force is inextricably
linked with the experience of the resistance that objects in the world offer to
my explorations, most apparently my tactile ones, but not only. The experi
ence of this barrier reveals to me at the same time my corporeal subjectiv
ity, including its boundary.
Hence in Maine de Biran the body, rather than being an extended sub
stance only causally related to the mind or a nonconscious material attri
bute, belongs to the I as an original phenomenological fact, indeed as the
primary “fact of consciousness” that reveals to us our nature. Maine de
Biran’s body is lived, not just physical. It moves because it is intrinsically
animated, not because it is directed by a mind extrinsic to it; and it is given
as a phenomenological fact, not just as the causal antecedent or the silent
accompaniment of mental activity.
As I read it, Biran’s characterization of subjectivity as an active force
complements, at the experiential level, Spinoza’s view of the appetite as a
primary bodily and mental phenomenon. It refers to a primordial experi
ence of ourselves as striving bodily beings, which is constitutive of other
experiences. Moreover, because of its emphasis on the experience of effort,
compared to better-known phenomenologies of the body, Biran’s arguably
portrays a particularly thick or full lived body: he emphasizes its presence,
its striving corporeality, as opposed to its transparency or self-forgetfulness
in its dealings with the world (to use the terminology that I introduce in
chap. 5, Biran’s lived body comes with a high degree of self-luminosity or
self-intimation).13 This bodily thickness makes Biran’s philosophy, I believe,
particularly suitable for developing an account of affectivity in which the
body does not just tacitly operate in the world but is also experienced in its
visceral and kinesthetic dimensions as it does so (I explore the notion of the
lived body and its place in emotion experience in chapter 5).
Yet we need to wait until Michel Henry (1965) to find Biran’s account
of the lived body properly applied to affectivity. Biran himself, as Henry
points out, was prevented from doing so satisfactorily because of, once
again, residual Cartesian influences on his own view of affectivity. On the
one hand, Henry keenly defends Biran’s characterization of subjectivity as
effortful and corporeal; he even praises Biran for being the first philosopher
able to overcome Descartes’s mind–body dualism by refusing to reduce


10 Chapter 1
the body to mere lifeless extension. On the other hand, Henry finds vari
ous echoes of Descartes still lingering in Biran’s philosophy, notably in his
account of affectivity and other “passive” phenomena, such as sensation
and imagination. Henry (1965, chap. 6) points out that, in characterizing
subjectivity as effort, Biran limited it to an active force and was subsequently
at pains to make room in it for the passive dimension of subjectivity. To
the extent that affectivity also involves being affected (being “done some
thing”) and not just outward striving, in Biran it then had to fall outside
the domain of subjectivity. In fact, Biran often relegated it to a modality of
“organic life,” characterized as purely physical or subconscious—namely,
deprived of lived subjectivity. In this sense, Henry notes, Biran’s account
of affectivity and other passive phenomena is “strangely” like the account
of Descartes in his treatise on the passions: they depend on (are brought
about by) something that lies beyond the sphere of immanent subjectivity,
namely, on mere extension.
Henry’s own remedy is to view both passivity and activity as grounded in
a deeper foundation of corporeal subjectivity, a more fundamental “power”
(1965, 225) that is alive not just when one moves effortfully but also when
one is passively influenced. Henry speaks here of a “latent tension” experi
enced in the body, which is the “essence” of feeling and affectivity, as well
as of active motor effort; this tension is “the proper interior quivering of
knowing” (le propre frémissement intérieur du savoir), where this know
ing is “a life, not a dead knowing” (1965, 230). At this level of latent ten
sion, which Henry also characterizes as “an origin,” there is no room for an
opposition between passivity and activity; rather, this level is the common
root of both, the precondition of both.14
This bodily quivering is thus the most primordial level of subjectivity.
Henry sees it as a precondition for the passive phenomenon of affectivity.
Yet one can interpret it as itself already affective, in the sense of a source
of meaning for the being in question; the quivering being is affected, that
is, struck, touched, or moved by a sense, if minimal, of significance. This
interpretation fits well also with what Henry says in other parts of his book
about affectivity characterizing every experience: “Every thought is an
affective thought. ... Every experience has its own tonality” (1965, 199),
and “There is no room for distinguishing certain affective Erlebnisse [lived
experiences] from allegedly nonaffective ones, but all our experiences, as


Primordial Affectivity 11
they are our different ways of living, carry in themselves that which is precisely
the primary character of every life and of every experience, and which we
call here, for want of a better term, an affective tonality” (200; my transla
tion, my italics; German in original). This passage suggests that affectiv
ity for Henry is not restricted to a passive phenomenon underpinned by a
more fundamental level of “tension” or “power” but is itself, as “the pri
mary character of every life,” this more fundamental level.15
1.4 Heidegger’s Care and Moods, and Patočka’s “Physiognomic
Impressions”
Another author who can be regarded as endorsing the view that there is a
deeper and more primordial level of affectivity than individual emotions
is Heidegger—though his account pertains explicitly to human existence
only and in this respect does not support the enactive claim (discussed in
the next section) that all living beings are affective. However, we can draw
important parallels between his account of care and moods in Being and
Time ([1926] 1996) and the present notion of primordial affectivity, which
should become clearer as both are expounded.
Heidegger in Being and Time famously uses the term Dasein (usually trans
lated as “being-there”) to refer to human existence. Dasein is, most funda
mentally, that for which its existence is an issue. Dasein is purposeful and
goal oriented; it is “projected” toward its realization. As Heidegger also puts
it, Dasein is fundamentally (necessarily, constitutionally) characterized by
care (Sorge) for its activities and projects. One of the three inextricable con
stituents of care is what Heidegger calls, with a neologism, Befindlichkeit—a
term notoriously difficult to translate into English.16 The reflexive verb sich
befinden, from which it comes, literally means “to find oneself,” “to be” in
a certain state, and is used in two different ways: to answer the question
“where are you?” by saying, for example, “Ich befinde mich in der Uni” (I
am at the university), and to answer the question “how are you?” by saying,
for example, “Ich befinde mich gut” (I’m fine). Befindlichkeit thus refers at
the same time to “where” and “how” one finds oneself.17
To say that one of the ingredients of care is Befindlichkeit is to say that,
as concerned with its existence, Dasein always necessarily finds itself in
one way or another. These different ways in which Dasein finds itself are


12 Chapter 1
its moods, namely, specific ways in which it is attuned to the world (the
German term for mood here is Stimmung; the verb stimmen also means “to
tune,” as in “to tune a piano”). Heidegger discusses different moods in
Being and Time and other works. Most famously, he discusses the anxiety
(Angst) we find ourselves in when we contemplate our finite nature, our
being-toward-death.
Crucially for Heidegger, we cannot escape our moods, because our existence
is never care free; we are always attuned to the world in one way or another.
Even indifference, or better “everydayness,” is itself a mood. Likewise for the
allegedly disinterested theoretical attitude of science, which is itself a specific
mode of being attuned to the world. In other words, Heideggerian moods
are not interruptions of an otherwise moodless mind but are constitutive
of human existence. In this sense they are quite unlike the moods of affec
tive science, which are longer lasting than the emotions, but nevertheless
still contingent states of mind—mere colorations or “accompanying phe
nomena,” as Heidegger put it ([1926] 1996, 135). This point applies also to
scientific accounts that claim that moods, unlike emotions, are always pres
ent, albeit in an attenuated form (e.g., Davidson 1994; D. Watson and Clark
1994). In these accounts, mood remains a surface phenomenon, something
that “colors” the mind all the time but only happens to do so; arguably in
these accounts mood could be taken away from the mind, but the mind
would still be there. For Heidegger, on the other hand, moods are fundamen
tal, inescapable modes of being in the world that necessarily characterize our
existence; it is not possible for Dasein not to be in a mood.
Also, whereas in affective science moods are usually characterized as spe
cific feelings, namely, subjective experiences with distinctive qualities (e.g.,
of elation, irritability, anxiety), Heidegger emphasizes that moods are not
private states of mind but modes of being in the world: “Being attuned is
not initially related to something psychical, it is itself not an inner condi
tion which then in some mysterious way reaches out and leaves its mark on
things and persons”; rather, “Mood assails. It comes neither from ‘without’
nor from ‘within,’ but rises from being-in-the-world itself as a mode of that
being” (Heidegger [1926] 1996, 129). Thus Angst, for example, is analyzed
in terms of how one encounters the world; in this specific attunement, the
world takes on the character of “complete insignificance” (174), its objects
lose their familiarity, its context of practical meanings collapses onto itself.


Primordial Affectivity 13
Importantly, Heidegger’s moods are necessary conditions for anything
to matter to us. A detached, purely contemplative stance cannot disclose
anything relevant for Dasein. It is mood that constitutes the world as mean
ingful, and different moods disclose different meanings. Being in a fearful
mood, for example, discloses the world as threatening. A detached, purely
contemplative stance would not be able to do so: “Pure beholding, even if
it penetrated into the innermost core of the being of something objectively
present, would never be able to discover anything like what is threatening”
([1926] 1996, 130). As Guignon (2003, 183) puts it, in Heidegger’s account
“there is a reciprocal relationship between our purposive agency and the
practical contexts in which we find ourselves. Our goals, interests, and
needs structure the ways in which things will count for us in the context”
(recall Spinoza’s point that we do not first evaluate things as good or bad for
us and then strive for them; rather, it is our striving nature that determines
what counts as good or bad for us). This disclosive role is “primordial,” at
least in the context of Dasein: “The possibilities of disclosure belonging to
cognition fall short of the primordial disclosure of moods in which Das
ein is brought before its being as the there” (Heidegger [1926] 1996, 131),
namely, in which Dasein faces its own existence for what it is.
In spite of this acknowledgment of the primordial character of moods,
unlike the authors discussed earlier, Heidegger does not address the rela
tionship between affectivity and the body. In fact, his account, as others
have remarked, is strangely “disembodied,” in the sense that it does not
mention the body at all when characterizing moods.18 Yet an interest
ing proposal to synthesize Heidegger’s account of moods with Maine de
Biran’s account of the lived body has been provided by the Czech phe
nomenologist Jan Patočka (1907–1977). Patočka ([1995] 1998)19 endorses
Heidegger’s view of mood as a fundamental trait of our existence but also
explicitly criticizes him for failing to note and discuss mood’s bodily char
acter. Patočka then returns to Biran to emphasize the active, effortful, and
thus corporeal character of subjectivity. Patočka talks of the “energy” and
“primordial dynamism” (e.g., 40–46) that characterize our bodily subjectiv
ity, and at the same time our orientation and projection toward the world,
which we live as a correlate of this dynamism. In addition, he particularly
emphasizes the affective or moodlike nature of our corporeal existence. As
he puts it, the corporeal self always has an “emotional localization” (47).


14 Chapter 1
This emotional localization is experienced as bodily: “Mood constrains or
encourages us. We grasp it corporeally, we feel it in our dynamism” (79).
Yet far from being only an experience of one’s body, mood is always also
an experience of how one finds oneself in the world, namely, of one’s situ
atedness. In mood, Patočka says, the world “makes a certain impression on
us,” and the quality of this impression is corporeal, “physiognomic”: “The
ceiling presses upon us, the sky is leaden, the air is heavy, the surroundings
are boring” (132–134). In other words, in mood we experience our sur
roundings in distinctive ways, which depend on how those surroundings
impinge on or impress our body. The body here does not disappear; it is
not passed over or forgotten in one’s dealings with the world. Rather, the
body is present in experience and contributes to the quality of how we are
attuned to the world. Specifically, the way in which one finds oneself in the
world in different moods or attunements has an experiential counterpart,
which is thoroughly corporeal (it is a “physiognomic impression”); indeed,
the world is given to experience as a specific mode of bodily affection (in
chap. 5, I develop this idea further with the notion of “background bodily
feelings” in emotion experience).20
Patočka’s proposal also goes beyond Heidegger’s restriction of affectiv
ity to human existence. His account grants that not just adult humans
but “animals and children” as well experience the primordial dynamism
of their bodies, and accordingly the world as impressing on them. As he
writes, “human sensibility, must be in principle other than that of animals
and children. It must be more flexible, richer, and have a tendency to objec
tify itself in the perceptible world of objects. ... Something fundamental,
though, remains the same; ... the elementary protofact of harmony with the
world is the same for humans, children, animals” (133; italics in original).
Shortly thereafter, he adds that there is a “more elementary ground” to
Dasein’s existence, which is shared also by animals and children, namely,
“the world as an empathy of a kind.” As I understand it, Patočka’s point
here is that animals and children are not able to reflectively and actively
take up projects to determine the course of their existence; however, they
can still experience and make sense of the world—yet tacitly, from an
entirely immersed and nonmediated perspective, by “feeling it in” via a
direct “empathetic understanding” (an idea Patočka borrows from Herder)
that does not require thought and reflection. If this is the case, however,
children and animals must also have moods, which they experience corpo
really as different ways in which the world impresses itself on them.


Primordial Affectivity 15
1.5 Enactive Sense Making
The views presented so far apply at different levels—for example, Spino
za’s conatus pertains to all existence, whereas Heidegger’s moods concern
human existence only. In this sense they identify different phenomena, and
I do not intend to suggest otherwise. Yet they have something in common,
which is why I have presented them here together: they all acknowledge
a dimension of existence that, as I see it, is affective—that is, meaningful,
relevant, or salient for the agent at stake—without or before being bounded
into distinct emotions; in addition, this dimension grounds other forms of
mentality, namely, it makes them possible.
I turn now to the enactive approach, to show that it provides a biological
as well as phenomenological framework for the idea of a primordial dimen
sion of affectivity. In particular, from an enactive perspective, primordial
affectivity is neither restricted to the human case, nor extended to all exist
ing things, but pertains specifically to living systems in virtue of their orga
nization. The enactive notion of sense making in particular, which refers to
the capacity of all living systems to enact a meaningful world from a point
of view, lends itself naturally to being interpreted in this way—or so I shall
suggest.
In a nutshell, according to the enactive approach, all living systems are
sense-making systems in virtue of their autonomous and adaptive nature.21
Following Varela (1979), Thompson (2007, 44) defines an autonomous sys
tem formally as one whose constituent processes “(i) recursively depend on
each other for their generation and their realization as a network, (ii) con
stitute the system as a unity in whatever domain they exist, and (iii) deter
mine a domain of possible interactions with the environment.” These three
criteria characterize autonomous systems as operationally closed. Operational
closure refers to a specific kind of organization in which the results of the
operations performed by the constituents of the system remain within the
system itself. Crucially, operational closure does not imply that the system
is completely self-enclosed and sealed against the environment. On the
contrary, for the physical realization of autonomy, the operationally closed
network needs to be thermodynamically open, namely, able to continuously
swap matter and energy with the environment, to regulate its self-generat
ing activity, as well as its exchanges with the environment. Operational clo
sure, as the term indicates, thus refers not to material or energetic isolation
but to a specific mode of functional relatedness among the components of


16 Chapter 1
a system that makes the system autonomous. An important qualification is
that autonomous systems constitute and maintain their identity under pre
carious conditions. In other words, their constituent systems not only sustain
themselves as a network but also would not be able to sustain themselves
individually (they would extinguish) unless they were organized in such a
network (Di Paolo 2009, 16).
The paradigm and best-known example of an autonomous system is the
living cell. Its component processes are chemical, and their interrelation
takes the form of a self-producing metabolic network that also produces its
semipermeable membrane; this network constitutes the system as a unity
in the biochemical domain and determines a domain of interactions with
the world. This form of self-generating autonomy at the molecular level
has been characterized as autopoietic (Maturana and Varela 1980). Thus an
autopoietic system is a particular kind of autonomous system. Whereas all
autopoietic systems are autonomous, not all autonomous systems are auto
poietic: complex living systems such as multicellular metazoan systems,
nervous systems, insect colonies, and so on, are operationally closed but do
not possess a clear semipermeable membrane.22
Importantly, autonomous systems are inherently purposeful, in the sense
that they generate ends or purposes within themselves (see esp. Thompson
2007, chap. 6). In brief, this is because an autonomous system is at the same
time both the cause and effect, and the means and end, of itself: the activity
of each component causally influences the activity of all the others (and is
thus causally influenced by them); in addition, these causal influences are
the means to the self-maintenance of the system, and at the same time its
purpose.23
Combined with adaptivity, autonomy generates sense making, namely,
the system’s activity of assessing the environment as more or less conducive
to its continuation. Autopoietic autonomy by itself entails only a crude, all
or-nothing assessment: the system only appreciates that its condition is
either good or bad as it survives or disintegrates, respectively. An adaptive
autonomous system, however, brings forth a graded scale of values. To put
it succinctly (see Di Paolo 2005 for the original extended discussion), an
adaptive autonomous system is one that monitors and regulates itself with
respect to its conditions of viability in its environment and improves its
situation when needed. To take a much-cited example, think of a motile
bacterium that, to maintain itself, swims toward higher concentrations of


Primordial Affectivity 17
sugar and away from noxious substances. In doing so, it evaluates its viabil
ity with respect to its environment in various degrees. This graded assess
ment or evaluation—which, importantly, is not carried out by a separate
homunculus within the system but takes place implicitly as a function of
the organization of the system—is what in the enactive approach is called
“sense making.”
Sense making thus characterized necessarily entails a point of view from
which the system and the environment are evaluated. The adaptive autono
mous system is not just a unity of interrelations among processes but a
perspective on the world that generates meaning and norms for itself, a locus
of inwardness: “The key here is to realize that because there is an individual
ity that finds itself produced by itself it is ipso facto a locus of sensation and
agency, a living impulse always already in relation with its world” (Weber
and Varela 2002, 117). As Jonas ([1966] 2001) already put it, living organ
isms transcend the material that realizes them: they are living in virtue of
their organization, which enables them to differentiate themselves from the
inanimate world. This differentiation implies the appearance of inwardness
and selfhood: “There is inwardness or subjectivity involved in this tran
scendence, imbuing all the encounters occasioned in its horizon with the
quality of felt selfhood, however faint its voice” (Jonas [1966] 2001, 84).24
The enactive notion of sense making is also intimately related to the one
of Umwelt (literally, “world around”), in Uexküll’s ([1934] 2010) sense of
the environment as experienced or lived from the organism’s perspective.
For a living system to be a sense-making system is to live in a world that is
always an Umwelt, namely, an environment that has a specific significance
or value for it. Take again the example of motile bacteria swimming in a
sugar gradient. These cells tumble about until they hit an orientation that
increases their exposure to sugar and subsequently swim toward the high
est concentration of sugar, which is good for them because of how their
metabolism chemically realizes their autonomous organization (Thompson
and Stapleton 2009, 24–25). The important point is that the sugar gradient,
for the bacteria, is not just a neutral physiochemical world but an Umwelt
with a specific range of values for them: sugar is good, more sugar is bet
ter, less sugar is worse, noxious substance is bad, and so on. As Thomp
son and Stapleton put it, this example illustrates that “even the simplest
organisms regulate their interactions with the world in such a way that
they transform the world into a place of salience, meaning, and value—into


18 Chapter 1
an environment (Umwelt) in the proper biological sense of the term. This
transformation of the world into an environment happens through the
organism’s sense-making activity” (25).
Now, a fundamental tenet of the enactive approach is that all living
systems are cognitive systems (life is sufficient for cognition). “Cognition”
in this context ought to be understood broadly, to refer to “behavior or
conduct in relation to meaning and norms that the system itself enacts
or brings forth on the basis of its autonomy” (Thompson 2007, 126). The
enactive claim, then, is that all living systems are cognitive in the sense
that, in virtue of their adaptive autonomous organization, they behave
according to meaning and norms that they themselves bring forth (gener
ate) in interaction with the world. Note that this claim is tantamount to
saying that living systems are sense-making systems. Cognition, in other
words, is the activity of sense making.
This is clearly a very different characterization of cognition from the one
typically adopted, more or less explicitly, in cognitive science. Cognition
as sense making does not require a central executive system that represents
facts about the world, reasons about them, and generates rules for action.
Cognition from an enactive perspective is, rather, the capacity to enact or
bring forth a world of sense, namely, an Umwelt that has a special signifi
cance for the organism enacting it. That this is a cognitive relation of the
organism to the world can also be appreciated by noticing that it implies
a discerning perspective on the part of the organism—one from which the
organism discriminates or distinguishes what is good for itself from what is
bad, in various degrees (“to discern” literally means “to cut off, to divide”).25
For present purposes, what I want to emphasize now is that the enac
tive characterization of cognition as sense making entails that cognition
is simultaneously also affective. This claim is not explicit in the enactive
approach, but I think it follows naturally from the various points just
summarized. First, as we have just seen, the sense-making living system
is inherently purposeful; it aims at maintaining its unity and conditions
of viability. Its autonomous organization makes it into a system that con
tinuously aims or endeavors to be itself and as such is “concerned” about
its continuation (as often put in Weber and Varela 2002, following Jonas
[1966] 2001); in this sense, we can say that the living system also “cares”
about its existence, to use Heidegger’s term.26 Second, we have also seen
that sense-making systems are adaptive, that is, they monitor and regulate


Primordial Affectivity 19
themselves with respect to their conditions of viability. To do so, they
must be able to discern what in the world is suitable for their continua
tion, and what is not. This is a cognitive-discriminative capacity, and at the
same time an affective-evaluative one that requires the living system to be
affected or struck by the suitability of an event for its own purposes. Third,
the notion of Umwelt is also thoroughly affective. The Umwelt is the world
as it strikes the living system as relevant for its purposes. It is not a flat land
scape of neutrality but a world of significance tailored to the living being
that enacts it. As such, the Umwelt represents what the living system sees as
relevant or salient, what matters to it and what it cares about. These points
are all interconnected. Immanent purposefulness and care are required to
discriminate what matters to the organism; at the same time, the world
takes on significance and value precisely in relation to what the organism is
concerned about and striving for—there is no meaningful environment for
the indifferent, nonmotivated being.
To clarify, these considerations are not meant to imply that all living
systems, including the simplest ones such as bacteria and other microor
ganisms, can have different emotions. The idea is, rather, that primordial
affectivity is a source of meaning that grounds (makes possible) the richer
and differentiated forms of sense making in more complex organisms, such
as the emotions of animals and human beings—including what are often
characterized as the “cognitive” or “highly cognitive” human emotions
(such as guilt, romantic love, resentment, and so on). This is a version of
the thesis of the deep continuity of life and mind, which, as mentioned in
the introduction, lies at the core of the enactive approach. According to
this thesis, as we saw, mind shares the organizational properties of life, and
richer forms of mind depend on richer forms of life. The idea, then, is that
the richer and more differentiated emotions that one finds in animal and
human lives are enrichments of the primordial capacity to be sensitive to
the world.
Nor is the notion of primordial affectivity meant to imply that even the
simplest living systems are conscious. According to the enactive approach,
the continuity of mind and life is admittedly also phenomenological (Thomp
son 2007, 129; 2011a; 2011b). What this means, however, is not that con
sciousness, not even in some minimal nonreflective form, is present in all
forms of life. Rather, the idea here is that the autonomous and adaptive
organization of living systems sets up an asymmetry between them and the


20 Chapter 1
rest of the world, such that living systems realize a perspective or point
of view from which the world acquires meaning for them, and not vice
versa. Thus a kind of “inwardness” is present already in the simplest living
systems, and the suggestion is that, as it is realized in more complex organ
isms, this inwardness becomes a conscious perspective.27
1.6 Primordial Affectivity and Affective Science
Before concluding this chapter, I want to qualify my initial claim that affec
tive science works with a narrower conception of affectivity than the one
articulated here. As mentioned (and as discussed in more detail in the next
chapter), the emotions of the affective scientist are short-lived episodes.
As such they have relatively clear-cut boundaries, and between them there
is no emotion. Other affective phenomena that are sometimes (although
rarely) mentioned in affective science are moods, usually considered less
intense and longer lived than emotions. Yet moods do not appear to be
better candidates for primordial affectivity; like the emotions, moods are
temporary perturbations of an otherwise neutral, nonaffective mind. Even
if moods last longer than emotions (or may be always present, as some have
proposed), still the assumption appears to be that moods are not constitu
tive of the mind but merely contingent superficial colorations.
There are, however, some exceptions. A few scientists have advanced
theoretical constructs that go beyond affectivity narrowly conceived. These
constructs come close to the phenomenon I am interested in; however, as
we shall see, they still fall short of it in some respects.
One such construct is the idea of core affect proposed by James Russell
(e.g., Russell 2003). Core affect is an ever-present “primitive” and “raw”
feeling constituted by a certain degree of hedonic tone or valence (pleasant
ness or unpleasantness) and felt arousal.28 It does not depend on language
and becomes part of different emotions via a process of “psychological con
struction” (more about this idea in the next chapter). It is a ubiquitous
feeling of how the organism is faring, an assessment of its condition. Thus,
like primordial affectivity, it is pervasive and exceeds individual emotions.
Note, however, that it remains a “neurophysiological state” (Russell 2003,
148), and its relationship to the organism seems to be solely one of con
scious detection or representation of it. Core affect is a “consciously acces
sible” neurophysiological state (148) that represents whether the organism


Primordial Affectivity 21
is drowsy, alert, in pain, and so on. Primordial affectivity as I have charac
terized it, however, is not meant to depend on the nervous system alone.
Rather, it is enacted by the whole organism, and indeed even by organisms
that lack a nervous system. Second, primordial affectivity, as we saw, is at
the same time the bringing forth of a world of significance, an Umwelt.
Core affect, on the other hand, remains limited to a perception of how
the organism is faring. Third, core affect is a feeling, a conscious experi
ence, whereas, as we saw, primordial affectivity need not be conscious.
Finally, core affect remains distinct from cognition. It can influence it and
be influenced by it but is by itself noncognitive. Hence core affect, unlike
primordial affectivity, is not conceptualized in terms of a simultaneously
cognitive-affective phenomenon.
Another interesting construct is the idea of vitality affects proposed by
Stern (1985, 53–61). These are mainly proprioceptive and kinesthetic expe
riences imbued with affective qualities, such as feelings of muscular tension,
contraction, and resistance, or of ease of movement, fluidity, and unob
struction, which come with a degree of felt arousal and changes in hedonic
tone accompanying shifts in bodily dynamics. These vitality affects also
come to the fore in bodily expressive forms of art such as dance, where
bodily movements often convey extremely specific qualities—of energy,
explosiveness, lightness, heaviness, frenzy, tranquility, and so on (see also
Sheets-Johnstone 1999; 2009, discussed in chap. 5). Other examples include
being touched in specific ways, as when one is comforted by being patted
on the shoulders—a gesture that has a soothing quality and characteristic
rhythm; importantly, the same vitality affect can be conveyed in a differ
ent modality, for example, by the repetition of the words “there, there,”
which has a similar rhythm. Vitality affects as Stern characterizes them are
not “regular affects” but rather “noncategorical” feelings with fuzzy bound
aries, for which there are no distinctive labels. Unlike regular affects that
come and go, vitality affects are ever present (Stern 1985, 54) and appear to
be intrinsic to our bodily existence. As such, although they are most appar
ent in the prelinguistic experiential world of infants (Stern’s primary focus),
they are presumably still present in adult experience and will come to the
fore in some activities more than others.
The notion of vitality affects does not belong to “mainstream” affective
science; for example, it does not feature in the recent Oxford Companion to
Emotion and the Affective Sciences (Sander and Scherer 2009). Yet as Stern


22 Chapter 1
(1985, 55) himself emphasizes, vitality affects “are definitely feelings and
belong to the domain of affective experience.” He does not explain why
he considers them affective; however, in the present framework, they are
clearly such: they involve changes of the organism, which are experienced
in the form of proprioceptive and kinesthetic feelings meaningful to the
subject. As Patočka would put it, they are manifestations of the organism’s
primordial dynamism, at the same time implying a capacity to be corpore
ally sensitive to the world (Henry’s “interior quivering”). Aside from this
bodily dimension, however, vitality affects fall short of primordial affectiv
ity for the same reasons that core affect also does. Unlike primordial affec
tivity, and like core affect, vitality affects are not conceptualized as affective
as well as cognitive sense-making phenomena; they are primarily feelings
of one’s body. Also, like core affect, vitality affects are feelings, whereas pri
mordial affectivity need not be so. Finally, although we can assume that the
category applies also to animals, Stern (1985) remains silent on this point;
and in any case, the fact that vitality affects are feelings implies that only
organisms capable of conscious experiences will enjoy them. The notion of
primordial affectivity adds to this account the idea that affectivity is a prop
erty of the organization of living systems and as such appears even before
the simplest forms of consciousness.
An account that comes especially close to the present notion of primor
dial affectivity has been proposed by Antonio Damasio. Damasio (2003) in
particular relates his views of the workings of brain and body in emotion to
Spinoza’s account of the mind–body relation and the affects, endorsing his
claim that emotions are modifications of the body, and the ideas of these
modifications. Importantly for present purposes, Damasio (2003, 31–34)
characterizes the emotions as the branches of a tree, whose lowest part of
the trunk consists of basic organismic self-regulatory processes (metabo
lism, homeostasis) shared by all living systems. Whereas a human emotion
is “a complex collection of chemical neural responses forming a distinctive
pattern” (53), simple emotional responses are present in all living organ
isms, including, for example, the unicellular paramecium, whose activities
consist in swimming away from danger (too much heat, too many vibra
tions) and toward nutrients. “The events I am describing in a brainless crea
ture already contain the essence of the process of emotion that we humans
have” (41). Damasio thus acknowledges a deep level of self-regulatory pro
cesses that count as “affective” in the sense that they reflect life’s adaptivity


Primordial Affectivity 23
and concern for itself (see also Damasio 2010, chap. 2, for a discussion
of life, self-regulation, and biological value). His conception of emotion
is clearly broader than the one typically assumed in affective science and
converges with the enactive claim that metabolism and homeostasis, as
basic life-sustaining processes, are deeply continuous with mentality and
constitutive of a level of existence that can already be seen as affective. In
addition, Damasio identifies a category of background emotions, which does
not correspond to any of the emotion categories of the affective scientist
but exceeds them; background emotions are manifested in, for example,
energy or enthusiasm in one’s attitude, “subtle malaise or excitement, edgi
ness or tranquility” (2003, 43). Background emotions depend on the ongo
ing self-regulatory activity of the organism and as such are ubiquitous and
intrinsic to embodied life.29
Although it is common nowadays to regard emotions and moods as
affecting and being affected by the organism’s self-regulatory processes,
the idea that brainless creatures can be characterized as having emotion is
not particularly prominent among affective scientists—quite the opposite.
Emotions are usually regarded as requiring relatively complex organisms.
For example, another eminent affective neuroscientist, Jaak Panksepp, pos
its a number of “primary” emotional systems in both human and animal
brains, but only in the mammalian brain (see, e.g., Panksepp 1998a, 2005).
Walter Freeman, whose views I present in more detail later in the book,
sees the limbic system as the primary source of emotion (affectivity, in my
terminology); however, in so doing, he limits it to organisms with a limbic
system. From the present perspective, what these accounts overlook is that
the fundamental processes of life regulation that enable organisms to main
tain themselves are already, in a primordial sense, meaning generating and
thus affective. Although only mammals may be able to display a variety of
emotions, simpler organisms already live in a meaningful world in virtue of
their capacity of being struck or influenced by what matters to them.
It should be noted, however, that, unlike the enactive approach, Dama
sio does not go as far as claiming that brainless creatures enact a world of
significance and are in this sense already cognitive. More generally, cogni
tion and emotion remain distinct in Damasio’s framework, with emotion
importantly cooperating with cognition to achieve intelligent behavior and
rationality. In his “somatic marker hypothesis,” for example, emotion in
the form of somatic states is characterized as cooperating with cognition to


24 Chapter 1
enable advantageous decisions (Damasio 1994). The hypothesis, roughly,30
proposes that cognition by itself, as realized by various “higher” cortical
areas, is not sufficient for making good decisions; the various possible out
comes of a decision also need to be associated with a somatic state (an
emotion). Thus Damasio retains a separation between emotion and cogni
tion, with emotion identified with bodily activity (and as such present in
all organisms) and cognition as a more complex dimension of the mind,
achieved by organisms provided with a nervous system, and more specifi
cally a cortex. From the present perspective, on the other hand, cognition,
like emotion, is already present at the level of sense making.
1.7 Conclusion
This excursus into the affective roots of the mind has served to provide a
background for the arguments of the rest of the book. From now on, I will
be concerned primarily with views and experimental work in current affec
tive science; however, every now and then, it will be useful to come back to
this primordial dimension, to ground the phenomena under analysis back
in their source and remind ourselves that the emotions studied by affective
scientists are not the only repositories of affectivity.
It is time now, however, to turn to affective science “proper,” and to
discuss some of its most influential conceptions of emotions in more detail.


2 The Emotions: Existing Accounts and Their Problems
2.1 Introduction
The primary object of study of affective science is not affectivity as charac
terized in the previous chapter but relatively short-lived and bounded epi
sodes during which specific feelings are experienced, and specific changes
in one’s body and behavior become apparent. These episodes are what affec
tive scientists usually refer to as the emotions. To some extent, this use of the
term overlaps with the folk psychological one; in my experience, when you
ask someone who has never really given the matter much thought what
emotions are, he or she will often answer by giving examples of relatively
short-lived episodes, such as a fit of anger or a pang of jealousy.
In this and the following chapter, I address the question of how we
should conceptualize these episodes. I often use the term emotional episodes
in place of “emotions,” to make it clear that I am concerned with occur
rent events. This qualification is needed because, as Goldie (2000) empha
sizes, the English folk psychological conception of emotion is broader than
the scientific one and includes phenomena that are not episodic, such as
enduring dispositions or longer-lasting feelings (think of lifelong love).1
Although I say something about longer-lasting affective phenomena such
as moods in the next chapter, I am overall primarily concerned here with
short-lived occurrent events. It is these phenomena I have in mind when I
use the term “emotions.”
There are several scientific accounts of the emotions, and little agreement
among them. I am dissatisfied with most of them, as this particularly criti
cal chapter shows. Whereas the next chapter provides more constructive
arguments, here I explain why I think that the most influential accounts of
the emotions provided in affective science are problematic. Ultimately my
aim here is to pave the way for the more positive view of the next chapter,


26 Chapter 2
where I present and discuss what I think is a more plausible account—one
that is also consistent with the enactive approach. In this chapter, however,
I leave the enactive approach aside and focus instead on mainstream scien
tific frameworks.
I begin by illustrating the main tenets of what is arguably the most influ
ential paradigm in affective science: the theory of basic emotions (BET from
now on). Before drawing attention to what I consider BET’s most serious
shortcomings, I discuss some existing criticisms of it that I think miss their
mark. To clarify, the aim of this discussion is not to support BET but to try
to put some order in an increasingly complex debate by pointing to argu
ments raised against BET that I think are misguided. The main problem
with BET, in my view, is that it has fostered the impression that empirical
evidence points to the existence of a small number of basic emotions
when, in fact, the process that has led to this view, as I show, is fraught
with arbitrariness. Yet this view not only persists but is self-reinforcing, as
affective scientists tend to conceptualize and investigate the alleged “basic”
emotions differently from the “nonbasic” ones. A related problem regards
the relationship between alleged basic and nonbasic emotions: if only a few
emotions are basic, then how do they relate to the nonbasic ones? I criticize
both the proposal that basic emotions are building blocks of nonbasic ones
(a version of what is known as the unity thesis) and the proposal that basic
emotions are entirely distinct from nonbasic ones (the disunity thesis). My
conclusion ultimately is that affective scientists would be better off drop
ping the notion of basic emotions. Toward the end of the chapter, I turn
to the most influential alternatives to BET—the psychological constructionist
and the componential approaches—and also highlight what I think are their
own limitations.
2.2 The Theory of Basic Emotions (BET)
According to BET, at least some emotions are basic; that is, they are geneti
cally determined sets of instructions called affect programs that, once acti
vated, generate a series of distinctive changes in the brain, as well as in
behavior, expression (typically facial, but also vocal and bodily), and physi
ology or autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity.2 The term “affect pro
gram” was introduced by Sylvan Tomkins (1962, 144): “By innate affect
programs we refer to what is inherited as a subcortical structure which can


The Emotions 27
instruct and control a variety of muscles and glands to respond with unique
patterns of rate and duration of activity characteristic of a given affect.” The
term was then taken up by others; according to Paul Ekman (1980a, 82),
for example, “The term affect program refers to a mechanism that stores the
patterns for these complex organized responses, and which when set off
directs their occurrence.”
The responses set off by affect programs are considered to be the same
for each basic emotion in all populations. Early evidence for this claim
came from various cross-cultural studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s,
which typically involved taking pictures of an actor expressing different
emotions, and asking people from different countries to say which emo
tions these pictures expressed. When subjects had to answer by matching
the pictures with pregiven emotion labels, a high degree of agreement was
found in their responses, even when subjects came from distant countries
(such as the United States, Brazil, Japan, New Guinea, Borneo, and more;
see Ekman, Sorenson, and Friesen 1969; Izard 1968, 1969). The now famous
study by Ekman and Friesen (1971) in particular found high levels of agree
ment even among the Fore in New Guinea—a preliterate people who at the
time had had minimal or no visual contact with Westerners. In this study,
in each trial the experimenters showed participants (both adults and chil
dren) a set of three pictures of emotional facial expressions; each picture
represented the expression of one of six emotions (fear, anger, happiness,
sadness, disgust, and surprise). At the same time, participants listened to
a very short story designed to represent one of these emotions (the sto
ries were very simple scenarios, such as “her friends have come and she is
happy” and “she is looking at something that smells very bad”). After each
story, participants were asked to point to the picture of the facial expres
sion that best fitted the emotion described in the story. Results showed that
Fore subjects matched stories and pictures in the same way as Western sub
jects. The only significant difference was that the Fore did not distinguish
between fear and surprise, which Ekman and Friesen explained, rather hast
ily, with reference to the prevalence of surprising frightening events in the
life of the Fore.
Since then, the six facial expressions used in this study have been
regarded as distinctive of basic emotions and present in all cultures (pan
cultural), with the later addition of contempt (Ekman and Friesen 1986;
Ekman and Heider 1988). Ekman, Levenson, and Friesen (1983) also


28 Chapter 2
provided evidence for their physiological differentiation. The facial expres
sions used by Ekman and Friesen are still extensively used in the laboratory
as experimental stimuli and as indicators of basic emotions. Psychologists
and neuroscientists are also busy looking for patterns of neural, behavioral,
and autonomic activity distinctive of each basic emotion, and for patterns
of neural activity correlated with the recognition of basic emotions in oth
ers. Basic emotions in BET are often also characterized as discrete, although
what this means is not particularly clear (I discuss the issue of discreteness
in more detail in the next chapter).
Importantly, BET sees basic emotions as adaptations selected by evolu
tion because they enabled our ancestors to cope with “fundamental life
tasks” (Ekman 1999, 46).3 Basic emotions in addition are taken to be initi
ated by automatic appraisals or “auto appraisals” (Ekman 2003) that mark
the beginning of the emotional episode, which is typically short-lived and
subsides as its various manifestations terminate. Ekman (1999, 56) has pro
vided a list of the characteristics “which distinguish basic emotions from
one another and from other affective phenomena”:
1. Distinctive universal signals
2. Distinctive physiology
3. Automatic appraisal, tuned to:
4. Distinctive universals in antecedent events
5. Distinctive appearance developmentally
6. Presence in other primates
7. Quick onset
8. Brief duration
9. Unbidden occurrence
10. Distinctive thoughts, memories images
11. Distinctive subjective experience4
Basic emotions, once activated, cannot be interrupted. However, their
outputs can be “masked” as a consequence of acquired display rules, namely,
“conventions, norms and habits that develop regarding the management of
emotional responses. A display rule specifies who can show what emotion
to whom, and when” (Ekman 1980a, 87). Individuals learn how to regulate
their expression and behavior, so that these “can become so well learned
that they operate automatically and are called forth when the affect pro
gram is set off” (89). A much-cited study in this context is Ekman 1971,
which found that Japanese subjects, when they are aware that they are being


The Emotions 29
observed while watching distressing movies, smile more than American sub
jects; nevertheless, as shown by slowed-down movies of their facial expres
sions, Japanese subjects still manifest distress before putting on the smile.
BET is not the first theory to posit some emotions as primary or funda
mental. The Stoics already distinguished four basic types or species of emo
tion (Brennan 2003). In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophy,
it was also common to distinguish between simple and complex emotions.
Descartes and Spinoza both suggested that some emotions are more primi
tive than others; so did Malebranche, Hume, Locke, and others (see Schmit
ter 2010). Note, however, that BET differs fundamentally from these early
proposals because it posits basic emotions as biologically basic. Previous pro
posals primarily distinguished the emotions into simple and complex ones
mainly on the basis of psychological considerations, such as the complexity
of their cognitive antecedents or components. They also usually saw simple
emotions as parts of complex ones; indeed, positing simple emotions was
one way to explain the complex ones. BET, on the other hand, character
izes basic emotions primarily in terms of the changes they bring about in
the organism, and their character of adaptations. In this sense, BET is dif
ferent also from more recent accounts that aim at identifying conceptually
basic emotion categories. A conceptually basic emotion category is one that
occupies a privileged position in a conceptual taxonomy, for instance, by
being learned first in development, by being produced more quickly by
adults in various laboratory settings, by being designated by shorter names,
and so on (e.g., Fehr and Russell 1984). As Scarantino and Griffiths (2011)
rightly emphasize, the notion of biologically basic emotions is orthogo
nal to the one of conceptually basic emotions, as well as to the one of
psychologically basic emotions—which, among other things, implies that
evidence that some emotions are, for example, conceptually basic cannot
be used to claim that they are also biologically or psychologically basic, and
vice versa (see also Ortony and Turner 1990).
2.3 Assessing Existing Criticisms of BET
Several criticisms have been raised against BET. Although, as will become
clearer in the next section, I think that BET is indeed problematic and the
notion of “basic” emotions should be abandoned, I also think that many of
its criticisms miss their mark.


30 Chapter 2
First, it follows from the last point of the previous section that BET can
not be rejected on the basis of arguments from cross-cultural linguistic dif
ferences. We know from linguistic and anthropological evidence that the
English terms for basic emotions do not have equivalents in all languages:
the English term “fear,” for example, appears to have no equivalent in Ifa
lukian, Utku, and Pintupi; the term “sadness” has no equivalent in Tahitian;
likewise for “disgust” in Polish, Ifalukian, and Chewong (Russell 1991; see
also Wierzbicka 1999). Yet this evidence does not imply that fear, sadness,
and disgust do not exist in these cultures. Russell (1991, 440) remarks that
“it is puzzling why a language would fail to provide a single word for an
important, salient, discrete, and possibly innate category of experience—if
such exists.” However, as he also quickly acknowledges, “one must recog
nize that the existence of basic emotions does not entail nor is entailed by
the existence of universal categories for understanding emotions. There is
no guarantee that human beings have got the matter right” (441).
Indeed, languages have their own life, so to speak; they are influenced
by sociocultural norms, and their terms can change their meanings more
or less subtly over time as a function of use and changes in social practices.
Linguists are familiar with the phenomenon of lexical lacunae, namely, the
lack of words corresponding to concepts for which other languages have
one or more words. Yet importantly linguists also acknowledge that lexical
lacunae may be an index that certain phenomena are hypo-cognized (Levy
1984) in a culture, that is, relatively unattended and little valued, rather
than nonexistent (see Ogarkova, forthcoming). In addition, it is important
not to overlook that lexical lacunae refer specifically to missing one-word
equivalents, and not to the impossibility of expressing and understanding
the phenomena for which these terms are missing. In translation, lexical
lacunae can often be replaced with multiword expressions; it is also often
possible to find words that, in the given context, are suitable substitutes for
the missing ones (again, see Ogarkova, forthcoming). Absence of an emo
tion term thus does not necessarily indicate absence of the corresponding
emotion. Indeed, BET supporters usually emphasize that affect programs
have nothing to do with language. Ekman has reiterated various times that
he is primarily interested in facial expression, and more generally emotion,
rather than emotion words. According to BET, affect programs exist and
are activated irrespective of their labels (to emphasize this language inde
pendence, Panksepp [2005], for example, indicates brain systems for basic


The Emotions 31
emotions with capital letters, such as RAGE, FEAR, PLAY), and there is no
expectation that one-term words for them will exist in all languages.
This is not to deny that language can influence and change our emo
tions. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, language can do many things to
our feelings (Colombetti 2009), including contributing to the construction
of culture-specific emotional niches. As we saw in the previous chapter,
organisms are open to the world and can change their structure in response
to changes in the world; language, like other cultural artifacts, can impinge
on this malleable structure to mold our emotional repertoire in different
ways (and the next chapter will particularly emphasize the variability and
context dependency of the emotions). Yet for the time being, the point is
just that arguments from cross-cultural linguistic differences do not under
mine the claim (supported by empirical evidence) that some organismic
features recur reliably across cultures and languages in comparable situa
tions. There appear to be similarities in emotional manifestations across
populations that are resistant to linguistic practices.
A second criticism of BET that I think misses its mark addresses the forced
choice methodology of the early experiments on the recognition of posed
facial expressions. We saw that in Ekman and Friesen’s (1971) study, sub
jects had to match one of three facial expressions with a pregiven scenario;
they were thus not allowed freely to label or describe the facial expressions
portrayed in the pictures. In his critique, Russell (1994) points out that
previous studies that had not adopted this forced-choice method found
that subjects gave very different responses, including responses that did not
involve emotional labeling at all (e.g., Frijda 1953). Studies that explicitly
asked subjects to label expressions with emotion words found more agree
ment, but only by grouping different responses together as belonging to the
same emotion cluster (for example, in Izard 1971 responses such as “dis
tress,” “loneliness,” “pain,” “pity,” and “worry” were considered correct for
the expression of sadness; see Russell 1994).
These findings are certainly interesting and suggest that we do not read
specific emotions straightforwardly “out” from faces. Yet they are not damn
ing for BET. Supporters of BET could respond that, indeed, emotion recog
nition never happens entirely out of context, as a readout from the face.
The face provides important clues, but not the only ones that subjects rely
on when they attribute emotions in everyday interactions; hence it is not
surprising that when no response options are provided in an experimental


32 Chapter 2
setting, subjects are not very good at recognizing expressions and come
up with different interpretations (for recent evidence that context influ
ences perception of facial expressions, see Barrett and Kensinger 2010). This
concession does not warrant the radical conclusion that facial expressions
do not play any role in how emotions are attributed to others, and the
rejection of BET’s main tenet that at least some emotions are expressed
panculturally in the face in the same way. Such a conclusion would need
to be supported by evidence that BET’s basic emotions are expressed by
facial expressions that are differently judged in different cultures, as well as
by evidence that they are produced differently in different cultures. To my
knowledge, no such evidence has been provided.
A third criticism that has been raised against BET accuses it of overlook
ing and downplaying the rich variety of the emotions, in particular their
context sensitivity (e.g., Russell 2003; Barrett 2006a). In BET, this criticism
implies, the affect programs appear to be very much like the keys of a key
board: when the key “anger” is pressed, a set of anger-specific changes occurs
in the organism; when “fear” is pressed, fear-specific changes occur, and so
on. Yet, the criticism continues, we clearly manifest anger, fear, happiness,
and so on, in many different ways, depending on the situation we are in.
Thus when angry I may bare my teeth and frown (as in BET’s prototypical
facial expression of anger), but I may also smile (e.g., with sarcasm); when
happy I may jump for joy and laugh but also cry; when scared I may retreat
but also respond aggressively; and so on (see also Ortony and Turner 1990).
In other words, this criticism challenges the view that a one-to-one corre
spondence exists between BET’s basic emotions and their manifestations.
It is certainly true that we manifest sadness, anger, happiness, and so
on, in different ways; the question, however, is whether this is fatal for
BET, specifically for its claim that at least some emotions are manifested
panculturally in the same way. Note first that BET accommodates behav
ioral variability by appealing to display rules (as in the case of the sarcastic
expression I put on when I am angry, instead of punching my adversary in
the face). Also, supporters of BET could insist, in some cases at least, that
some seemingly nondistinctive expressions are in fact distinctive of basic
emotions. For example, they could insist that when an Olympic champion
cries on the podium, she is not in fact “crying for joy”; rather, as long as she
cries and manifests sadness, she is sad (maybe because she is remembering
past efforts and sacrifices to achieve this result; maybe her body is releasing


The Emotions 33
accumulated tension in the form of crying, which makes her feel sad, and
so on). Or they could appeal (as in fact they do) to the possibility that affect
programs blend and thus produce mixed expressions and manifestations.
Moreover, Ekman has recently conceded that affect programs are not
closed but open (from Mayr 1974); namely, they can be modified in the
course of life as a consequence of the organism’s interactions with the envi
ronment (Ekman 2003; Ekman and Cordaro 2011). So even if affect pro
grams, once activated, cannot be interrupted, still they may change over
one’s lifetime, by including instructions for blocking the occurrence of
some of their manifestations. The openness of affect programs is an impor
tant concession to the role of learning and culture in modifying basic emo
tions; however, BET can endorse it without giving up the claim that we and
other animals are biologically prepared to manifest at least some emotions
in specific ways, and that these manifestations appear to be stable across
contexts.
Finally, consider also that Ekman and collaborators specify that basic
emotion categories refer to emotion families. Each family is organized
around a theme, which is “comprised of the characteristics unique to that
family” and is “influenced phylogenetically” (Ekman and Cordaro 2011,
365); variations on the theme are the product of social influences and
learning. This claim is problematic in that it does not clarify how one is
to distinguish the theme from the variations: is frustration a variation of
anger, or vice versa? And if one finds pancultural elements in both frus
tration and anger, should one conclude that the latter are themes of two
distinct families? For present purposes, however, what matters is that BET
recognizes that basic emotion categories should not be taken to imply a
strict one-to-one correspondence between an affect program, understood
as an internal cause, and its outputs (although variability within a family
remains constrained by the theme).
A fourth criticism of BET points out that affective scientists have had
difficulty identifying distinctive brain and autonomic response patterns
that occur reliably in situations allegedly activating affect programs. Bar
rett (2006a) points out that meta-analyses of a large number of studies
have failed to reveal reliable one-to-one correspondences between alleged
basic emotions, and neural as well as autonomic activity (Phan et al. 2002;
Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, and Lawrence 2003; Cacioppo et al. 2000). Bar
rett takes the results of these works to provide further evidence that BET


34 Chapter 2
is wrong; if it were correct, distinct and reliably recurrent neural and ANS
patterns for each basic emotion should have been detected.
The authors of the meta-analyses of brain studies mentioned by Barrett,
however, interpret their results as more supportive of BET than she does
(although not as conclusive). The main reason is that such results do in
fact show some consistency in brain activity for a few emotions. Phan et al.
(2002) looked at the results of fifty-five PET and fMRI studies of five emo
tions in humans (fear, anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness) and found
that in 60 percent of the studies looking at fear, activation in the amyg
dala was significant compared to activation in other areas; they also found
that 60 percent of the studies looking at disgust significantly engaged the
basal ganglia, and 46 percent of the studies looking at sadness significantly
engaged the subcallosal cingulate. Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, and Lawrence
(2003), for their part, looked at 106 PET and fMRI studies and found that in
40 percent of the studies looking at fear, activation in the amygdala was sig
nificant compared to activation in other areas; this percentage increased to
over 60 percent when they looked at a subset of fear studies that had used
only facial expressions as stimuli. They also found that in 70 percent of
the studies of disgust, insula and globus pallidus (a component of the basal
ganglia) activation was comparatively significant, and lateral OFC (orbito
frontal cortex) activation was significant “in a higher proportion of studies
of anger, relative to other emotions” (225). Unlike Phan et al., they did not
find that sadness and happiness co-occurred with significant activation in
distinct brain areas. In their view, differences in their results were attribut
able to the different number of experiments they took into consideration,
as well as to the fact that only their analysis looked at experiments with
carefully controlled neutral control conditions.5
Now, these results are certainly not very clean, and admittedly there are
limitations to the meta-analytic method—not least that studies that fail
to find significant activations are usually not published and thus do not
make it into the analyses in the first place. The authors of the mentioned
meta-analyses themselves acknowledge these limitations and also provide
suggestions for further methodological improvements. Yet, discrepancies
aside, it seems to me that one cannot overlook the fact that some recur
rent activation of the same area or areas was found across studies for more
than one emotion, largely consistently also with neuropsychological evi
dence from lesion studies. Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, and Lawrence (2003)


The Emotions 35
mention some of these studies—for example, lesions to the amygdala have
been found to disrupt the recognition of fear signals, as well as the acquisi
tion and expression of fear response; similarly for the basal ganglia, insula,
and disgust (for a review of amygdala and anterior insula lesion studies,
see Calder, Lawrence, and Young 2001), and for the orbitofrontal cortex
and anger. To which we can add evidence from animal studies, which have
revealed that electrical brain stimulation of distinct areas can induce spe
cific behaviors such as laughter, seeking, and aggression (Panksepp 1998a,
2005). Finally, a variety of chemical substances such as norepinephrine,
serotonin, dopamine, vasopressin, oxytocin, and others, are associated
with different behaviors and experiences (see Panksepp 2007 for a review of
this evidence specifically in response to Barrett 2006a).
In addition, a more recent meta-analysis has confirmed and refined pre
vious findings. Vytal and Hamann (2010) focused on eighty-three neuro
imaging studies (PET and fMRI) published from 1993 to 2008 and used a
different statistical method to analyze their results, called ALE (activation
likelihood estimate). ALE preserves the three-dimensional spatial informa
tion of the original activations and generates statistical maps of significant
brain activations across multiples studies. Vytal and Hamann identified
significantly consistent and discriminable patterns of brain activation for
happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust, which overlapped considerably
with those identified (partially) in the previous meta-analyses. Moreover,
they were able to further differentiate between the emotions for which
previous meta-analyses could not find distinct patterns. Specifically, even
when they included only the studies used by Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, and
Lawrence (2003) in their analysis, they were able to show differentiation
between happiness and sadness.6
As for ANS activity, in a recent meta-analysis of 134 studies that looked
at direction (increase or decrease) of several autonomic variables (such as
heart rate, skin conductance level, finger temperature, diastolic and systolic
blood pressure, respiration rate, and so on), Kreibig (2010) found what she
interprets as “considerable specificity.” The emotions she looked at (four
teen overall) were not just the alleged affect programs but also emotions
such as affection, amusement, pride, relief, embarrassment, and suspense.
Because she looked at many dimensions of arousal, the results of her analy
sis cannot be summarized briefly. In some cases she found that the same
emotion ought to be divided into two subforms whose ANS activity recurs


36 Chapter 2
relatively consistently across studies. For example, she found that disgust
toward polluting or contaminating stimuli (such as pictures of dirty toilets
or cockroaches) is associated with different ANS activity compared with
disgust toward stimuli like mutilation, injury, and blood (see also Harrison
et al. 2010), and that sadness differs in ANS activity depending on whether
it involves crying or not.
In sum, the results of existing meta-analyses do not indicate total lack
of patterning and emotion specificity. Existing evidence remains consis
tent with the claim that a number of emotions come in relatively recurrent
patterns of neural and ANS activity. Importantly, as we shall see in the
next chapter, this stability need not imply that neural and autonomic pat
terns are products of prewired affect programs. Yet it indicates that “there is
something” in, or better “of,” the organism, which remains relatively stable
for at least some emotions (versus, as we shall see, the radical claim that
emotions are not “entities”).
More generally, this section has argued that BET cannot be dismissed by
pointing to cross-cultural linguistic differences, differences in attribution
on the basis of facial expressions, and variability in behavioral, neural, and
autonomic manifestations. True, BET has had to weaken or adjust some of
its assumptions to make room for these differences (and the adjustments
are sometimes very ad hoc). But the take-home message remains that in
spite of all the undeniable variability, there still seems to be something that
recurs reliably and manifests some degree of stability or robustness across
contexts.
2.4 The Arbitrariness of the Alleged Basic Emotions
In my view, the main problem with BET is that it has fostered the convic
tion, now widespread in affective science, that available evidence supports
the existence of a small number of pancultural emotions with characteristic
manifestations (typically Ekman and Friesen’s first “basic” six, with some
minor differences), and accordingly also the existence of several emotions
that are not pancultural and do not have any distinctive organismic traits.
As we are about to see, the process that has led to this conviction is fraught
with arbitrariness.
Note first that the view that only some emotions are “basic” is not
Ekman’s, at least not anymore. In recent papers, he has emphasized that


The Emotions 37
“all emotions are basic,” and he “does not allow for non-basic emotions”
(e.g., Ekman 1994, 1999, 2003; Ekman and Cordaro 2011).7 He presents this
view explicitly as a hypothesis that needs to be further investigated empiri
cally, with the aim of finding distinctive and pancultural expressions, and
autonomic and neural mechanisms, for different emotions. Ekman and
Cordaro (2011) specifically suggest that ten “enjoyable emotions” (sensory
pleasures, amusement, relief, excitement, wonder, ecstasy, schadenfreude,
rejoicing, Yiddish Naches, and Italian fiero—the last two are variations of
pride), as well as guilt, shame, embarrassment, envy, and familial compas
sion, may be pancultural and associated with distinct autonomic profiles.
The reason for the claim that “all emotions are basic” is that Ekman does not
endorse what we can call the building-block view of the emotions, according
to which some emotions are components of others. Unfortunately, how
ever, the term “basic emotions” strongly suggests such a view. It is not
surprising, then, that Ekman has tried to distance himself from the term,
recommending, for example, that “the adjective ‘basic’ should not be the
issue” (Ekman 1999, 57). Rather, the main issue for him is the pancultural
character of the emotions, and their character of adaptations. In this sense,
his view is similar to the one of the evolutionary psychologists Cosmides
and Tooby (2000), according to which all emotions are adaptations to
recurring situations, namely, mechanisms evolved to take advantage of the
structure of situations that were common in the past of our ancestors.8 Note
also that the expression “basic emotions” appeared only gradually in the
writings of Ekman and collaborators. Neither basic nor primary emotions
are mentioned by Ekman and Friesen (1971), who were solely concerned
with showing constants across cultures in the facial expression of emotion;
there is also little reference to primary or basic emotions in Ekman and Fri
esen 1975 and Ekman 1980a.
Irrespective of Ekman’s current stance, however, BET has acquired a life
of its own, and the received view in affective science today is that only
some emotions are basic, whereas others are not. In a recent special issue of
Emotion Review dedicated to basic emotions, all defenders of BET other than
Ekman and Cordaro (2011) endorse the view that basic emotions are a subset
of the emotions: Izard (2011, 372) distinguishes between first-order emotions
(which require minimal cognitive antecedents) and emotion schemas (which
involve complex interactions between feelings and cognitive processes)
and claims that “first-order emotion feelings may serve as building blocks


38 Chapter 2
for many, though by no means all, other emotions”; Levenson (2011, 379)
claims that “only a subset of discrete emotions is basic” and suggests that
basic emotions may be “building blocks” of more complex ones; and Pank
sepp and Watt (2011, 389) similarly claim that primary-process emotions are
probably “building blocks for higher emotions such as guilt, hatred, loneli
ness; that is, emotions molded by cognitive attributions.”
This view may well have been encouraged by Ekman and collaborators
themselves, at least initially. As one reads in Ekman (1980b, 137; my ital
ics), for example, in his view he and Friesen had “isolated and demon
strated the basic set of universal facial expressions of emotion.” Yet the early
studies did not support this statement, because they investigated only six
emotions (all of which were subsequently characterized as basic). Moreover,
those six emotions had not been chosen by Ekman and Friesen on the basis
of a clear rationale. Rather, the process whereby they have come to be seen
as “the basic ones” was quite arbitrary. This process goes back to Tomkins
(1962, 1963), who, on the basis of his reading of Darwin ([1872] 2007),
hypothesized the existence of nine primary affects, so called in his work by
analogy with the “primary drives” of thirst, hunger, sexual desire, and pain.
Tomkins’s nine primary affects were surprise-startle, interest-excitement,
enjoyment-joy, anger-rage, distress-anguish, fear-terror, shame-humilia
tion, disgust, and “dissmell,” or response to unpleasant smells (the first
term of each pair denotes the mild version of the affect, the second the
more intense). Now, contrary to what is almost invariably implied in papers
and talks about BET, this list did not come from Darwin. In fact, Darwin
([1872] 2007) never suggested that some emotions are primary or basic.
He illustrated and discussed the expressions of a large number of emotions
as manifested in different human cultures and even in animals, including
emotions that never made it into Tomkins’s list—such as sense of impo
tence, contempt, wonder, guilt, pride, and more. Darwin meticulously
noted facial and bodily expressions for each of these emotions, from appar
ently pancultural to more culture-specific ones. On the basis of reports and
pictures from correspondents in various parts of the globe, he observed,
among other things, that shrugging the shoulders in impotence, sneering
in contempt, and averting the gaze in guilt appear to occur panculturally.
So why did Tomkins propose those nine affects as primary? I could not
find any valid justification for this choice, only some vague considerations,


The Emotions 39
such as that the nine primary affects are “the primary motives of human
beings” (1962, 111–112). No argument was given, however, as to why these
affects are “primary motives,” and no explanation provided to clarify the
relationship between motivation and alleged nonprimary emotions: are
nonprimary emotions not “primary motives,” and if so, why not?
Note also that whereas Darwin had described facial, as well as vocal and
bodily, expressions associated with different emotions, Tomkins decided
to identify the face as “the primary seat of affect.” This choice was once
again not supported by a clear justification. Tomkins (1962, 205) says in
this respect only that “the face expresses affect, both to others, and to the
self, via feedback, which is more rapid and more complex than any stimu
lation of which the slower moving visceral organs are capable.” It remains
unclear, however, why rapidity and complexity of feedback should suffice
for establishing the “seat of affect”; slower changes in the viscera may (and,
as we now know, do) also bring about changes in emotion experience and
behavior.
Ekman and Friesen (1971) thus started from an already arbitrary list.
From it, they selected six emotions for their study, leaving out interest
excitement, distress-anguish, and dissmell. Why? I could not find any
explanation for this decision in their work. The arbitrary character of this
choice was confirmed to me at the 2011 meeting of the International Soci
ety for Research on Emotion (ISRE) in Kyoto. There Phoebe Ellsworth,
who had collaborated with Ekman and Friesen in the 1970s and had been
involved in the selection of the stimuli for their experiments, gave a talk in
which she explained that their original aim had indeed been to study all of
Tomkins’s nine affects. Eventually, however, they had ended up studying
only a subset of them because they could not sample enough pictures for
nine facial expressions that satisfied their criteria (namely, the pictures had
to be of different individuals, both males and females, and be known to
elicit high agreement among American subjects).
In light of this process, one should be wary of the claim that only a few
emotions are basic or, rather, that only a few emotions have distinctive man
ifestations and are expressed panculturally in the same way. There is just
not enough evidence for this claim. True, there is not much evidence either
for the claim that emotions other than the alleged six (more or less) basic
ones have distinctive traits that also appear cross-culturally. However, this


40 Chapter 2
is precisely because of the widespread conviction that only a few emotions
are basic. The conviction that emotions such as jealousy, shame, envy, love,
and so on, are not basic and thus do not have distinctive manifestations has
discouraged the study of their neural, behavioral, and bodily features, in
the same as well as in different cultures (which, incidentally, also represents
a marked departure from Darwin’s approach, as he included observing and
describing both pancultural and culture-specific expressions of emotion).
We thus know little about the physiology, expression, and brain processes
of emotions other than the alleged basic ones, which reinforces the convic
tion that only some emotions have distinctive and pancultural features.
Importantly, this trend is changing, although slowly. Research on pride, for
example, has revealed that expressions of pride are reliably discriminated
from expressions of happiness, even by four-year-old children (Tracy, Rob
ins, and Lagattuta 2005). Research on shame in humans and primates sug
gests that it is accompanied by patterned ANS activity, characteristic neural
activity, and possibly a distinctive facial expression (see J. Clark 2010).
This story, in my view, far from suggesting—as Ekman would—that all
emotions may be basic, indicates that the notion of “basic” emotions is
redundant and misleading, and affective scientists would be better off if
they dropped it. They could still look for pancultural and stable features
of emotional manifestations, however, without any obligation to classify
them as “basic” and thus to draw a dividing line between different kinds of
emotions. Rather, as Darwin did, they could happily carry out research on
both pancultural similarities and cross-cultural differences, with the aim to
provide, first, accurate descriptions of what changes in which context and
what stays the same, and then explanations of why this is so, without the
need to posit any invariant building block (I reiterate this point in the next
chapter, in the context of more constructive arguments).
2.5 The Problematic Unity/Disunity Debate
Getting rid of the notion of basic emotions would also eliminate the need
to explain how alleged basic emotions relate to nonbasic ones. This need so
far has generated accounts that in my view are problematic, in various ways.
We have already seen that, according to many supporters of BET, basic
emotions are building blocks of nonbasic ones, namely, constitutive parts
of them. This view is a version of what has been dubbed in the philosophy


The Emotions 41
of emotion the unity thesis (see Prinz 2004b), so called because it claims that
basic and nonbasic emotions are nevertheless unified under the broader
natural category of “emotion.” Unlike the unity thesis, the disunity thesis
(Prinz 2004b) claims that basic and nonbasic emotions are profoundly dif
ferent; basic emotions are not parts of nonbasic ones, the two form two
distinct phenomena for which separate theories need to be developed,
and the category of “emotion” should be split accordingly. Now, because
both theses endorse the view that only some emotions are basic, they are
already problematic: as we saw, no conclusive evidence supports this claim.
In addition, both theses have difficulties of their own, which are useful to
consider in some detail.
Supporters of the building-block view have proposed two main “unify
ing” mechanisms (see also Griffiths 1997; Prinz 2004b): blending and what
I shall call cognitive elicitation. According to Plutchik (2001), for example,
eight primary emotions are organized in a circle in a specific order (i.e., joy,
acceptance, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, anticipation) and blend
like colors to form primary, secondary, and tertiary dyads. For example,
joy and acceptance, which are contiguous on the circle, blend to form the
primary dyad of love; acceptance and fear blend into the primary dyad of
submission; fear and surprise blend into the primary dyad of awe; and so
on. Joy and fear, which are separated by one emotion on the circle, form
a secondary dyad and blend into guilt. Joy and surprise, which are sepa
rated by two emotions on the circle, constitute a tertiary dyad and blend
into delight (for the whole range of possible combinations, see Plutchik
2001). According to Damasio (1994), on the other hand, primary emotions
engage deeper and older brain areas in the limbic system and are activated
automatically without the intervention of the cortex.9 The automatic fear
response that many animals exhibit in front of predators, for example, is a
primary emotion. When mechanisms for primary emotions are elicited cor
tically, they give rise to secondary emotions, as in the case of fear elicited
by deliberation (rather than automatically). Damasio’s (1994) framework
is consistent with LeDoux’s (1996) model of the double pathway for the
elicitation of fear. According to it, primary fear is elicited entirely subcorti
cally, by stimuli that enter the sensory thalamus and feed directly into the
amygdala via a “quick and dirty” pathway (supporting evidence shows that
cats and rats whose cortical components of the auditory system have been
damaged still exhibit fear conditioning to auditory stimuli). Secondary or


42 Chapter 2
“cognitive” fear occurs when the amygdala is activated via the cortex, along
a slower pathway that typically involves deliberation.
Both proposed unifying mechanisms are problematic. Most apparently, in
Plutchik’s model it is not clear whether the various dyads are merely mixtures
of basic emotions or involve some extra component. Mere blending does not
seem sufficient to account for the resulting emotions. Phenomenologically,
love is certainly not merely a blend of joy and acceptance, for example, and
guilt is not a blend of joy and fear. In addition, both love and guilt involve
different thoughts, different action tendencies, and different behavioral
manifestations from those of their alleged components, and so on.
Damasio’s way of drawing the distinction between primary and sec
ondary emotions (and LeDoux’s related double-pathway model) is also
problematic, although in a different way. It is based on an increasingly
controversial view of the brain (although arguably still an influential one),
according to which emotion and cognition are neurally distinct, with emo
tion residing in the deeper areas of the brain, and cognition depending pri
marily on the higher areas. Yet as we shall see in more detail in chapter 4, it
does not seem possible to parse the brain into lower emotional and higher
cognitive areas; rather, cognition and emotion overlap and are distributed
over the whole brain (Lewis 2005; Pessoa 2008). Also, deeper brain areas
are intimately interconnected with cortical ones; they are modulated by,
and in turn modulate, cortical activity at various stages. The amygdala, for
example, is influenced by activity in the visual cortex and at the same time
modulates how it responds to visual stimuli. In addition, subcortical areas
can process stimuli not just coarsely but in a detailed way (see Adolphs and
Pessoa 2010).
Another building-block version of the unity thesis has been advanced
by Prinz (2004b). According to him, all emotions are embodied appraisals,
namely, perceptions of bodily changes that have the function of tracking or
representing specific properties in the environment, such as danger, insult,
and so on (following Lazarus 2001, Prinz calls these core relational themes;
see also chap. 4). Basic emotions have been naturally selected to represent
a limited set of core relational themes. Nonbasic emotions are either blends
of basic emotions or basic emotions (or blends thereof) recalibrated in
development so as to represent new themes. For example, schadenfreude,
according to Prinz, is a recalibrated nonbasic emotion constituted by the
perception of bodily changes distinctive of joy (a basic emotion), which
have come to represent the new theme of “others’ suffering.”


The Emotions 43
There is, however, no empirical evidence for the view that some emo
tions involve the “same” bodily changes of others. Indeed, this is an empiri
cal question that cannot be answered a priori. In addition, Prinz’s account
is phenomenologically perplexing in that it entails that recalibrated emo
tions must feel like the basic emotions of which they are recalibrations.
Prinz follows James (1884, [1890] 1950) in claiming that a felt emotion is
the perception of the bodily changes that occur during it. But then, because
recalibrated emotions and the basic emotions of which they are recalibra
tions are supposed to involve the same bodily changes, they must also feel
the same. Indeed, Prinz (2005, 19) suggests that guilt feels like sadness,
“indignation feels like anger, disappointment feels like sadness, awe has an
element of surprise, contempt has an element of disgust, pride feels like a
kind of joy, exhilaration feels like a blend of fear and joy, and jealousy feels
like a blend of anger, disgust, and fear.” Yet it is plainly not the case that
we experience only a limited number of basic feelings that remain the same
in different contexts (including when they are brought about by judgments
not previously associated with them, as in the case of recalibrated emo
tions). In my experience, guilt feels very different from sadness, in terms of
bodily sensations, thoughts, perceived opportunities, and so on. Likewise
for exhilaration and fear, jealousy and disgust, and so on.10
What about the disunity thesis? It has most notably been defended by
Griffiths (1997), according to whom basic emotions are modular structures
homologous to structures in nonhuman animals, whereas “higher cogni
tive emotions” are complex, uniquely human emotions, not homologous
to states in other species. (Homology in comparative biology refers to
shared descent from a common ancestor and is typically contrasted with
analogy. Homologous traits have similar structure, whereas analogous traits
have only superficial resemblance. For example, the human hand and the
whale’s flipper are homologous: they both descend from the tetrapod’s
limbs, as shown by their similar bone structure. The wings of the bat and of
the bird, on the other hand, are only analogous: they are superficially simi
lar and both enable flying, but they do not come from a common ancestor.)
Because of this fundamental difference, according to Griffiths, basic and
higher cognitive emotions do not form a unified class, and affective scien
tists should drop the category of “emotion” to replace it with at least two
distinct ones, for which distinct theories should be elaborated.
Note first that in proposing the disunity thesis, Griffiths was mainly
motivated by negative considerations, particularly the problematic nature


44 Chapter 2
of building-block views such as Plutchik’s and Damasio’s. Yet rejecting
unity altogether is not the only alternative to the building-block view (as
we will see in more detail in the next chapter). The major problem with the
disunity thesis, in my view, is that it does not sit well with what we know
about the brain. Basic emotions are for Griffiths (1997) modules in Fodor’s
(1983) sense: they are inescapable, opaque to our cognitive processes and
awareness, and most importantly informationally encapsulated, namely, they
“cannot access all the information stored in other cognitive systems, and
... can store information that contradicts that other information” (Griffiths
1997, 93). Basic emotions are embedded in the deeper and older limbic
system; if they were integrated within cortical systems, Griffiths argues,
they would lose their rapidity and with it their selective advantage. This
account is broadly consistent with some current affective neuroscientific
ones, according to which a small number of “primary-process emotions”
are situated in ancient subcortical areas of the brain. Evidence for these
mechanisms has been provided by artificially activating subcortical circuits
in animal brains (e.g., Panksepp 1998a; Panksepp and Watt 2011).
Note first, however, that automatic elicitation and informational encap
sulation need not be supported by dedicated subcortical structures. They
may also be supported by cortical structures, or integrated cortical-subcor
tical ones, as a result of the organism’s interactions with the environment
over development. We know, for instance, that fear conditioning can be
induced in decorticated rats (LeDoux 1996). However, we also know that
in nondecorticated animals, the cortex does play a role in fear condition
ing. For example, Schneidermann et al. (1974) exposed nondecorticated
rabbits to two tones, one of which was associated with an electrical shock;
accordingly, rabbits started to exhibit fear conditioning to that tone. How
ever, when the experimenters lesioned the auditory cortex of the rabbits,
they exhibited fear conditioning to both tones (see LeDoux 1996, 161).
This result suggests that even in the case of automatic fear responses to a
conditioned stimulus, the cortex is involved; in particular, it contributes
to discriminating the conditioned stimulus from non-conditioned ones.
Without cortex, such discrimination does not occur. As Hardcastle (1999,
242) puts it, “It takes both the cortex and the amygdala, working together,
to create fear in intact rabbits”; the intact brain appears to take advantage of
its complexity and exploit all its resources, so that “without cortex, you get
one neuronal configuration; with cortex, you get another” (243).


The Emotions 45
More problematic is Griffiths’s characterization of higher cognitive emo
tions. He does not say anything about their neural substrate, and in fact he
declares that he “cannot do much more than gesture” (1997, 91) at what
he means by higher cognitive processes. In his account, however, higher
cognitive emotions do not include basic emotions. Even when emotions
such as fear, anger, sadness, and so on, are triggered by cognitive processes
(which Griffiths thinks is possible, see p. 92), these do not involve basic
emotions; rather, they are very different emotions that require different
explanations. This account implies lack of overlap between brain areas
for basic emotions, and brain areas for higher cognitive emotions. Here
is where what we know about the brain suggests otherwise. As mentioned
earlier, we know that the brain is highly integrated across older and newer
structures. So even if some older structures may in some contexts underpin
mandatory responses blind to declarative knowledge, this does not mean
that they are always isolated from other parts of the brain. The amygdala,
for example, is located in older subcortical parts of the brain and has reli
ably been found active in quick-and-dirty fear responses. However, it is also
known to be a “hub” that projects widely to both cortical and other subcor
tical areas (Pessoa 2010). Consider also the phenomenon of vertical integra
tion, which refers to dense bidirectional connectivity and reciprocal control
between regions distributed along the whole neuraxis (Tucker, Derryberry,
and Luu 2000). This indicates that structures that underpin mandatory and
encapsulated responses are not necessarily insulated from the rest of the
brain. More specifically this implies that older neural areas for basic emo
tions are not necessarily insulated from neural mechanisms underpinning
the higher cognitive emotions. The higher cognitive emotions may involve
parts of, or even all, neural mechanisms for basic emotions by integrating
them into different neural patterns (incidentally, the idea that deeper and
evolutionarily older brain structures participate with more recent ones to
support new emotions or new functions of the same emotion is now wide
spread in affective neuroscience).
Griffiths (1997, 103–104) rejects the idea that higher cognitive emotions
can come to include basic emotions by eliciting them through cortical acti
vation because, he claims, no empirical evidence supports it. I agree that
no evidence points to the existence of nonemotional cognitive appraisal
processes taking place in the cortex that bring about emotional responses in
lower parts of the brain (see chap. 4). Evidence does suggest, however, that


46 Chapter 2
the cortex is integrated with subcortical areas in such a way that if those
areas are disrupted, cognitive activity is also impaired. Take, for example,
the ventral tegmental area, located in the basal ganglia beneath the cortex;
this area contains dopamine and projects richly to the prefrontal cortex,
to the point that damage to the basal ganglia impairs the development of
the cortex and leads to mental retardation (Quartz and Sejnowski 2002,
91). Another example is that congenital and early damage to the amygdala
disrupts the capacity to understand others, such as the capacity to detect
tactless or ironic comments and to interpret nonliteral utterances (Shaw
et al. 2004). Also, inhibition of the noradrenergic system of the amyg
dala disrupts the capacity to form long-term memory (Ferry, Roozendaal,
and McGaugh 1999). These results strongly suggest that parts of the brain
involved in “higher cognitive emotions” are not distinct and separate from
those involved in basic emotions, although, of course, more evidence is
needed about the neural activity underpinning them.
In sum, then, distinguishing basic from nonbasic emotions has created
a need to account for how these two classes of emotions relate to each
other. Proposed accounts, however, I have argued, are problematic—which
should count as another reason to drop the notion of basic emotions. To
anticipate, in the next chapter I defend a view of all emotions as complex
dynamical patterns of brain and bodily events, which could be seen as a
version of the unity thesis, according to which, however, there are no emo
tions that are building blocks of others.
2.6 Alternatives to BET and Their Problems
BET is arguably the most influential framework in affective science, but it is
not the only game in town. Alternatives have been proposed, which, how
ever, I believe, have difficulties of their own. I discuss here in particular two
of the most influential alternatives to BET and explain why I think they are
problematic. These are the psychological constructionist models proposed by
James Russell and by Lisa Barrett, and the component process model proposed
by Klaus Scherer.
According to both Russell and Barrett, all emotions have something in
common; more precisely, they all vary along a small number of dimen
sions—hence the characterization of their models as “dimensional.” Their
models explain the occurrence of emotional episodes in a very different
way from BET.11 According to both, crucially emotions are not organismic


The Emotions 47
“entities.” There are no basic emotions in the sense of genetically prede
termined internal causes of behavior, feeling, and so on. There are, at best,
prototypical emotional episodes that recur relatively reliably across contexts
and cultures. These episodes, however, are psychological constructions just
as any other emotional episode, including nonprototypical ones. In other
words, they are assemblies of a variety of psychological components. Those
components include, most fundamentally, what Russell has called core
affect, namely (as we saw in the previous chapter), a degree of felt arousal
and affect valence:
[Core affect is] that neurophysiological state consciously accessible as the simplest raw (nonreflective) feelings evident in moods and emotions. ... At a given moment, the conscious experience (the raw feeling) is a single integral blend of two dimensions. ... The horizontal dimension, pleasure–displeasure, ranges from one extreme (e.g., agony) through a neutral point (adaptation level) to its opposite extreme (e.g., ecstasy). The feeling is an assessment of one’s current condition. The vertical dimension, arousal, ranges from sleep, then drowsiness, through various stages of alertness to frenetic excitement. The feeling is one’s sense of mobilization and energy. (Russell 2003, 148)
In Russell’s model, core affect is always present and is independent from
language and categorization. It is “primitive, universal and simple” (148).
Core affect is already affective, but in an emotional episode it is typically
“loosely linked” (Russell 2005, 38) to other psychological components such
as appraisal (the evaluation of a situation in relation to one’s own needs
or goals), specific subjective quality (feelings of fear, shame, etc.), action
tendencies, meta-awareness, and others. The details of these components
need not concern us here. The important point is that for Russell, how
these components generate an emotional episode is not a matter of biology,
so to speak, but depends on available “mental scripts”: “The set of events
picked out by the English word fear is not a biologically given category.
Indeed, the present analysis predicts that there is no neural circuit, peptide,
or other biological marker that is unique to fear. ... Instead, to categorize is
to note a resemblance between observed components and a mental repre
sentation, which is here thought of as a mental script” (Russell 2003, 151).
In other words, perceiving an emotion in oneself and others depends on
the existence of a mental script for that emotion. The mental script enables
one to see or pick out a coherent set of properties in the organism (experi
ence included). The mental script includes language-dependent emotion
categories (fear, anger, shame, etc.) and also “specifies a temporally ordered
and causally linked sequence of subevents” (164).


48 Chapter 2
Barrett’s “conceptual act model” is similar. It denies the existence of
basic affect programs, posits the dimension of valence as “a basic build
ing block of emotional life” (Barrett 2006c), and denies that the emotions
are “biological entities” independent of language and categorization. This
model particularly emphasizes that “emotions are not biologically given,
but are constructed via the process of categorization” (Barrett 2006b, 27). It
is categorization that parses what are at best weakly correlated component
processes into different items; categorization makes us experience our own
emotions as distinct feelings, and it also “shapes” our perception of other
people’s states.
I find these proposals unconvincing, primarily because they are too radi
cally dismissive of any role of the “biological” in emotional episodes.12 It is
right, I think, that mental scripts and language-dependent concepts play a
role in categorizing features of a situation as distinctive of a specific emo
tion. After all, we become familiar with the vocabulary of emotion by asso
ciation with situations that are described to us as characteristic of specific
emotions. In this view, recognizing emotions is a matter of matching an
acquired script with the features of a perceived event (see also the discus
sion of paradigm scenarios in De Sousa 1987, which he characterizes as cri
teria that enable us to make sense of our and others’ emotional responses).
Moreover, different languages are likely to parse perceived events in differ
ent ways.
Yet Russell and Barrett (and the latter seemingly more than the former)
attribute more to mental scripts and concepts than a role in categorization;
namely, they see them as “constructing” emotional episodes, by imposing
structure where they claim to be none, or very little at most. Thus Barrett
(2006a, 47) complains that “many of the most influential models in our
science assume that emotions are biological categories imposed by nature,
so that emotion categories are recognized, rather than constructed, by the
human mind.”13
But as we saw earlier, evidence for language-independent recurrent
patterns in emotional episodes is compelling and cannot be dismissed
altogether. It does not seem plausible to write off any role of biological
influences in structuring our emotional behavior, physiology, and expres
sivity, and to deny that emotions are entities in the sense of relatively
stable patterns of brain and bodily (including behavioral and expressive)
processes. Also, after all, when it comes to everyday face-to-face encounters


The Emotions 49
with others, mutual understanding relies largely on attributions of specific
emotions on the basis of facial, vocal, and bodily configurations (see also
chap. 7); and we respond consistently to art portraying emotions via facial
expressions, postures, movements, vocal expressions, and music (of course,
there are always exceptions, nuances, and idiosyncrasies). Barrett would
probably respond that the perception of emotions in others is enabled by
language-dependent concepts (see Barrett 2006b). However, animals and
infants respond reliably to others’ attitudes without or before acquiring
such concepts. Existing evidence does not support the claim that language
enables emotion perception altogether. Interesting experiments have shown
that priming information about specific emotions—for example, by having
subjects read scenarios representing different emotions—influences how
subjects categorize facial expressions; specifically ambiguous or neutral
faces tend to be interpreted as expressing the primed emotion, and nonam
biguous expressions are also influenced by the priming process (e.g., Trope
1986; Carroll and Russell 1996). These results, however, are not inconsis
tent with the claim that people produce distinctive facial expressions for
emotion. Another study has shown that repeating an emotion word thirty
times interferes with the categorization of facial expressions by slowing it
down and making it less accurate (Lindquist et al. 2006). Again, however,
pace Lindquist et al., this result is far from supporting the claim that “lan
guage forms the emotional reality that we experience” (135; my italics).14
Importantly, acknowledging this point does not commit one to endors
ing BET’s claim that basic emotions are genetically predetermined affect
programs. In the next chapter, I argue for an alternative view of the emo
tions that does posit the existence of coherent patterns of the organism and
yet does not assume that emotions are “internal causal entities” or “stored
patterns” that somehow bring about tightly connected outcomes. This
alternative, as we will see, endorses the claim that emotions are variable and
context dependent; at the same time, it explicitly addresses the question of
how coherent emotional episodes “come to be,” so to speak, and does so by
reference to principles of organization that are widespread in nature and do
not appeal to internal causes to explain patterned phenomena.
Another alternative to BET is the component process model (CPM),
pioneered by Klaus Scherer (see Scherer 2009 for a recent overview). Its
main contrast with BET is that it denies that patterned emotional epi
sodes are the output of innate affect programs. It also denies that there


50 Chapter 2
are basic emotions in the sense of emotions that enter other emotions as
components. All emotions, in the CPM, are characterized as “patterns of
synchronization” of five component subsystems driven by the cognitive
evaluative process of appraisal (itself a component of the emotion system).
Besides appraisal, the other component subsystems are autonomic physiol
ogy, action tendencies, motor expression, and feeling. More specifically,
the appraisal subsystem itself is divided into four distinct subprocesses that
appraise different aspects of an event and accordingly causally induce dif
ferent changes in the other emotional components. These four appraisal
subprocesses evaluate, respectively, the personal relevance of an event (does
this event affect me directly?), its implications (how will this event affect
my well-being and goals?), the subject’s coping potential (how well can I
cope with this event?), and the normative significance of the event (how
does this event relate to my values and norms?). In addition, each of these
appraisal subprocesses is divided into a number of “stimulus evaluation
checks” (SECs), each of which exerts a specific effect on other subprocesses
within the emotional episode (ANS, expressions, etc.).15 For example, the
“relevance” appraisal subprocess has an SEC for novelty, one for intrinsic
pleasantness, and one for goal relevance; the “coping” appraisal subprocess
has an SEC for control, one for power, and one for adjustment. A further
central assumption of this model is that the various appraisal subprocesses
and their SECs occur sequentially. Thus the implications of an event are
evaluated after appraisal of its relevance has been completed; the subject’s
coping potential in turn is evaluated after the event’s implications have
been taken into account; and the event’s normative significance is evalu
ated last. More specifically, during the evaluation of relevance, novelty will
be evaluated before intrinsic pleasantness, which in turn will be evaluated
before goal relevance, and so on.
The CPM predicts that different sequences of SECs will have different
effects on the various emotional subprocesses, thus generating emotional
episodes that will display a variety of different autonomic, motor, expressive,
and feeling aspects. Given the high number of SECs, many combinations
of these aspects will be possible. Some combinations will thus resemble the
basic configurations predicted by BET (Scherer calls these modal emotions),
yet importantly there will be many other configurations, corresponding to
episodes of shame, guilt, expectancy, relief, and so on. Moreover, the CPM
does not predict that there will be one distinctive configuration for each


The Emotions 51
emotion category; rather, there will be different configurations for shame,
jealousy, pride, and so on, and even configurations for which English does
not have a label, but that still count as emotional episodes.
This model is similar to Russell’s and Barrett’s in that it characterizes
emotional episodes as arrangements of component processes that do not
come in preestablished packages elicited by the activation of hard-wired
programs; rather, component processes “fluctuate,” so to speak, relatively
independently and can mix in various ways, thus giving rise to a range of
different emotional episodes. However, the component process model does
not claim that categorization is required to “bind” the components together
into an emotional episode. The components, rather, combine into a con
figuration as a consequence of the changes brought about in the emotion
system by the various SECs, which continuously scan the environment.
This approach does not suffer from the difficulties of the psychological
constructionist models. Also, it importantly emphasizes the temporal and
episodic nature of the emotions, the rich interactivity between the various
emotional component subsystems, as well as the complexity, variability,
and context dependency of the emotions. It is a particularly sophisticated
model that precisely specifies the mechanisms whereby emotional episodes
come about.
However, some aspects of this model remain perplexing. For one, it seems
unlikely that specific components such as individual facial muscle actions
(called “action units,” or AUs, in the literature) or dimensions of autonomic
arousal are guided by distinct appraisal subprocesses, or even sub-subpro
cesses such as SECs. Admittedly this is partly an empirical question. Scherer
and collaborators are engaged in a large project to test it in the lab, and some
interesting results have already been generated. Scherer and Ellgring (2007),
for example, have shown that actors rarely produce BET’s prototypical facial
expressions. Moreover, they found that the facial expressions produced
could be predicted by the model’s associations between specific action units
and specific SECs. For example, the model predicts that AUs 1 and 2 (inner
and outer brow raised) occur more in relation to novelty and lack of control;
consistent with this prediction, the actor study showed that these AUs are
indeed used mostly in emotions of panic, fear, anxiety, and despair.
Arguably, however, because individual muscles usually work not in isola
tion but as part of larger configurations, it seems possible that whereas some
AUs may depend on specific appraisals, others may just activate together


52 Chapter 2
and form a pattern as a function of muscular synergies. I discuss some rel
evant evidence in the next chapter. For now the point is that it appears
more natural, that is, more in line with principles of biological organiza
tion, to allow the organism to generate emotional episodes without the per
vasive guidance and control of an army of appraisal checks. Organisms are
highly complex and interconnected systems, such that changes in one part
typically modify the rest of the system. The CPM admits of interactivity
among components within the emotion system, but it ultimately reiterates
the driving role of the appraisal process in guiding the changes that occur in
the organism. As we saw, it also hypothesizes that the various SECs occur
sequentially in a specific order. The model thus leaves little if any room for
biological self-organization and complex reciprocal influences among dif
ferent organismic processes. We will look more in detail at these phenom
ena and their role in affectivity in the next chapter.
2.7 Conclusion
The debate about the nature of the emotions is complex and difficult to
navigate. In this chapter, I reviewed and discussed some of the most influ
ential accounts. After assessing what I consider misguided criticisms of BET,
I pointed to a major problem with the theory, namely, the arbitrariness
of the process that has led to the widespread view that evidence supports
the existence of a small number of basic emotions. I also criticized related
influential accounts of the relation between alleged basic and nonbasic
emotions, such as various building-block views of basic emotions, and the
disunity thesis—ultimately suggesting that it would be better to drop the
notion of “basic” emotions altogether. Then I turned to proposed alterna
tives to BET and found problems with them, too. In particular I argued that
the psychological constructionist models are too radical in their rejection of
the idea that emotional episodes are biological events and that they come
in recurrent organismic patterns, whereas the CPM, although sophisticated
and detailed, appears artificially overcomplicated and overlooks principles
of biological organization.
In the next chapter, I put forth more constructive arguments to depict a
different account of the emotions that, I believe, overcomes the difficulties
of existing approaches and fits better with accepted principles of biological
organization.


3.1 Introduction
The best way to conceptualize emotional episodes, I believe, is as dynamical
patterns. More precisely, emotional episodes should be understood as self
organizing patterns of the organism, best described with the conceptual tools
of dynamical systems theory (DST). DST is a branch of mathematics used to
model a variety of complex temporal phenomena. In the mind sciences, it
has been used to model a variety of cognitive phenomena. This “dynamical
cognitive science,” as Wheeler (2005) aptly calls it, is importantly related to
the enactive approach. It can be seen as a precursor of it, with roots in cyber
netics (see Pickering 2010), although it became more influential in cognitive
science only in the mid-1990s with the publication of works such as Thelen
and Smith 1994, Kelso 1995, and Port and van Gelder 1995.
The enactive approach takes from dynamical cognitive science the view
that cognition is a temporal phenomenon. It is particularly sympathetic to
what Thompson (2007, 10) calls embodied dynamicism, namely, the view
that cognitive systems are not just temporal but also embodied and situ
ated, involving “multiple simultaneous interactions” of brain, body, and
world (van Gelder and Port 1995, 23). Indeed, the very notion of autonomy,
which (as we saw in chap. 1) in the enactive approach captures a crucial
property of living systems, refers to a network of processes that influence
one another over time and in so doing generate and maintain the unity of
the network. As we shall see in more detail shortly, this kind of mutually
influencing relationship is precisely what can usefully be captured by DST.
In addition, the enactive approach has also begun to draw on what I
will call, by analogy with dynamical cognitive science, dynamical affective
science, namely, the application of dynamical systems concepts to affective
3 Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns


54 Chapter 3
and emotional phenomena (see Thompson 2007, chap. 12; Colombetti
2007; Colombetti and Thompson 2008). The aim of this chapter is, in brief,
to focus on this approach in detail, and to show that it provides a valuable
alternative to the theories of emotion discussed in the previous chapter.
After introducing some fundamental conceptual tools of DST, I distinguish
three strands within the dynamical systems approach in affective science,
highlight their distinctive claims, and eventually reconstruct a character
ization of emotional episodes consistent with all of them. I then move on
to spell out the implications that such a characterization has for the debate
on the nature of the emotions illustrated in the previous chapter. I also dis
cuss the implications of a dynamical systems characterization of emotional
episodes for further issues in affective science, such as the purported dis
creteness of emotions, and the relationship between emotions and moods.
3.2 Fundamental Concepts of Dynamical Systems Theory (DST)
DST is a branch of mathematics that describes the temporal evolution of
dynamical systems, namely, systems that change over time.1 What changes
over time is called the state of the system. Describing the temporal evolu
tion of a dynamical system requires one first to provide a number of state
variables that describe the state of the system at a given time. Next, one
needs to provide a rule of evolution that describes how the values of the
state variables change over time. When the system changes continuously
over time, this rule takes the form of differential equations (systems that
evolve in discrete steps do not need differential equations; difference equa
tions will do). Given the state variables of the system, it is possible to rep
resent all possible states of the system geometrically as a state space, such
that each point of the state space corresponds to a state of the system. As
the system changes its state over time, it moves from one point of the state
space to another, tracing a curve in it that is called a trajectory. The set of
all possible trajectories of a system is its phase portrait. Points or regions in
the state space toward which the system’s trajectories tend to converge are
called attractors. When a system is in a region of the state space such that
it will evolve into a particular attractor, that region is the attractor’s basin
of attraction. Points or regions in the state space from which the system’s
trajectories are deflected are called repellors, and the overall layout of attrac
tors and repellors in the state space is referred to as its topology. A bifurcation


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 55
or phase transition occurs when the phase portrait undergoes a qualitative
change as a consequence of small changes in the value of parameters affect
ing the behavior of the system (see hereafter for the notion of “control
parameter”), yielding a new topology.
Two or more dynamical systems are said to be coupled when they recipro
cally influence and constrain their behavior over time, such that they can
be modeled as one system. The phenomenon is often illustrated with the
example of wall-mounted pendulums (A. Clark 2001). If allowed to oscil
late freely, two pendulums hanging on the same wall will tend to swing
synchronize as time passes, via the vibrations of the wall. The movement
of one pendulum causes vibrations of a certain frequency that influence
the movement of the other pendulum, and vice versa. In DST this is math
ematically captured by a set of two differential equations (one for each pen
dulum) in which the evolution of each pendulum’s behavior is factored
into the equation of the other. The example of the wall-mounted pendu
lums also illustrates the phenomenon of entrainment, which occurs when
two or more coupled dynamical systems become synchronized, either via
a process of mutual influences or as one system adapts its motions to those
of the other(s).
Another important concept from DST is self-organization. Self-organiza
tion refers to the capacity of a complex system to generate and maintain
structured order within itself by way of mutual influences among its com
ponents. Autonomous systems, as defined in chapter 1, are paradigmatic
self-organizing systems: they are generated and maintained in virtue of
the influences that their constituent processes exert on one another. In
DST, an example often used to illustrate self-organization is the Rayleigh
Bénard instability (see Kelso 1995). When liquid is poured into a pan and
heat applied from below, rolling motions (“convection rolls”) in the liquid
appear that constrain (or, as it is sometimes said, enslave; see Haken 1977)
the range of possible behaviors of the liquid’s molecules. The amplitude
of the convection rolls is known as a collective variable; namely, its value
reflects the result of the mutual interactions of the various components
of the system (the liquid’s molecules, in this case). It is also referred to as
an order parameter, because it reduces the degrees of freedom of the liq
uid molecules and constrains them into an ordered pattern. Importantly,
nothing “controls” or “directs” the appearance of the convection rolls. The
heat applied to the pan in the Rayleigh-Bénard instability is sometimes


56 Chapter 3
characterized as a control parameter, namely, a factor that influences the
state of the system without being affected by it; aside from this influence,
however, the heat does not control the system in the sense of “instruct
ing” how it should behave or of “monitoring” its evolution. Rather, the
Rayleigh-Bénard instability instantiates what some call a process of circular
causality (Haken 1977): the initial disposition of the liquid’s molecules and
the temperature of the heat source applied to the pan influence the direc
tion of motion and the amplitude of the convection rolls; at the same time,
the appearance of convection rolls influences the behavior of the liquid’s
molecules by locking them into a certain range of motion.2
It is also useful to think of self-organization in terms of first- and second
order constraints (Juarrero 1999, 140–144; Thompson 2007, 424–425). First
order constraints refer to the influences that a system’s components exert
on one another. In the Rayleigh-Bénard instability, the reciprocal influ
ences among the molecules of liquid instantiate first-order constraints. Sec
ond-order constraints refer to the global influence that macrolevel patterns
or forms exert on the system’s components; in the Rayleigh-Bénard instabil
ity, the convection rolls provide second-order constraints as overarching
patterns that enslave the behavior of the liquid’s molecules.
Finally, the term emergence is often used to refer to the appearance of
interesting behavior in systems where several components influence one
another reciprocally and via circular causality (see A. Clark 2001, 113–114).
This notion of emergence, which I adopt here, does not commit one to the
further, stronger claim that entirely new ontological properties appear from
the interaction of components that do not themselves possess them (see,
e.g., Bitbol 2007 for a discussion and criticism of this notion of emergence).
As will become clearer shortly, in this chapter I am concerned not with onto
logical properties but with patterns of brain and bodily activity that appear
in emotional episodes as instances of the organism’s self-organizing activity.3
3.3 Dynamical Affective Science
DST has been adopted in different disciplines to model various physical,
biological, ecological, and social systems—such as lasers, ant colonies, bird
flocking, climate changes, economic behavior, and many more. As men
tioned earlier, cognitive scientists have also adopted DST to model a range
of cognitive phenomena. Several works already discuss the dynamical sys
tems approach in cognitive science,4 so I shall not illustrate it in any detail


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 57
here. I shall only mention that, in emphasizing the temporal character
of cognition, dynamical cognitive scientists typically take issue with the
view—widespread in more “standard” cognitive science—that cognition
is made up of static and context-free structures, and explaining cognition
is a matter of explaining how these structures can “represent” knowledge
and “control” or prescribe intelligent behavior. Explaining cognition,
dynamicists assert, is rather a matter of explaining how brain, body, and
world constrain one another to achieve adaptive behavior, and this kind
of explanation need not make any reference to internal representations. To
be sure, whether dynamical cognitive science can do without any kind of
representations at all is a debated issue, as is the more general question of
whether dynamical cognitive science is incompatible with, or rather com
plements, standard cognitive science (see discussions in, e.g., A. Clark 1997;
Wheeler 2005; Shapiro 2011). As I see it, from an enactive perspective, it is
possible to regard various aspects of dynamical systems (states, attractors,
trajectories, etc.) as having some kind of representational status, and this
may be useful for various purposes; however, one should keep in mind
that to do so is to take the system as heteronomous rather than autonomous
(Varela 1979; Thompson 2007, 49–51), namely, as characterized by inputs
and outputs, and by a transference of information from the inside to the
outside (and vice versa). When applied to cognitive systems, this perspec
tive thus obscures their autonomous character, and the related point that
a cognitive system generates or enacts meaning in virtue of its organiza
tion. As Thompson (2007, 51) remarks, “For the enactive approach it is the
autonomy perspective on natural cognitive agents that remains the refer
ence point for understanding mind and life, not a predefined input-output
task structure.”5
In any case, I need not dwell on this debate here. For my aims, the value
of DST lies primarily in that it provides conceptual tools enabling a charac
terization of emotional episodes as self-organizing patterns of the organism.
As such, as we shall see, emotional episodes are context dependent, flexible,
and “loosely assembled” and yet can also display stability across contexts
which has important implications for the debate about the nature of the
emotions discussed in the previous chapter.
To show this, I turn now to the dynamical systems approach in affective
science. Compared to dynamical cognitive science, this approach is rela
tively less known. One reason is perhaps the relative neglect of emotion in
cognitive science. Another reason is probably its predominantly discursive


58 Chapter 3
and qualitative character. Whereas dynamical cognitive science has pro
duced at least a few quantitative models that lend themselves to relatively
detailed scrutiny and assessment (see Thelen et al. 2001; R. D. Beer 2003),
dynamical approaches in affective science mainly just offer abstract dynam
ical qualitative descriptions of emotional phenomena, at disparate levels,
advancing quite general hypotheses about their emergent character.
In spite of its undeniably discursive and speculative character, I think
that the dynamical systems approach to emotion has much to recommend
and should not be dismissed too quickly. Note first that existing accounts of
emotions are not, by comparison, particularly strong mathematically and
quantitatively. Quite the contrary, qualitative psychological modeling pre
vails in emotion theory. Moreover, my primary concern here is theoretical;
the question I set up to examine is “what is the best way to conceptualize
the emotions?” and from this perspective, the conceptual resources made
available by dynamical systems theory are, I believe, particularly useful to
overcoming the difficulties of existing accounts (discussed in the previous
chapter).
In the following sections, I distinguish three strands of work within
dynamical affective science. One strand emphasizes the role of coordina
tive structures and preferential linkages among muscles in the production of
emotional expressions. Emotional expressions are seen not as the output of
internal, pregiven instructions (BET’s affect programs) but as the outcome
of synergistic processes of mutual constraints among muscles. The second
strand draws on work on brain plasticity and coherence to call attention to
processes of neural self-organization in the stabilization of brain structures
underpinning emotional episodes. The third strand applies principles of
dynamical systems theory to interpersonal relations, and specifically to the
emergence of patterns of emotional behavior between two or more agents.
In spite of their (very) different levels of description, these three strands
are compatible in that they all characterize the organism as complex, self
organizing, open, and plastic, realizing emotional episodes that are softly
assembled, context dependent, and highly variable, yet patterned and
recurrent.
3.3.1 Coordinative Muscular Structures
The dynamical systems approach to emotion expression can be traced to
Peter Wolff’s work on the development of emotional expression in infants
(smiling and crying in particular). Adopting an ethological method, Wolff


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 59
(1987) observed twenty-two infants at home in their first month of life to
make out their expressive repertoire and also informally manipulated their
activities to examine the conditions that give rise to specific behaviors.
These observations highlighted the variability of infant emotional expres
sions in relation to objects and people, showing that they rarely corre
spond to the prototypical configurations posited by BET. They also showed
that infant expressions, even if variable, still come in a limited number of
combinations of components and are relatively resistant to perturbation;
in addition, they are discontinuous (i.e., they do not gradually change as
stimulation gradually increases) and vary depending on the infant’s state at
the time of stimulation. According to Wolff, these observations were better
accounted for by a dynamical systems account, rather than by a “central
program” view entailing all possible responses being generated and con
trolled by internal rules (see also Camras and Witherington 2005).
Drawing on this work, Fogel and Thelen (1987) reinterpreted existing
evidence on the expression of emotion in infants from a dynamical systems
perspective. They focused on patterns of crying and smiling and on how
these change in the course of the first year of life. Rather than viewing these
changes as driven by transformations in brain structures taking place at
predetermined developmental stages, they proposed viewing them as emer
gent from the mutual influences of a variety of bodily and environmen
tal processes developing at different timescales. Take crying, for example.
Wolff (1967) had already identified different types of cry, which appear at
different moments during the course of the first year of life. He noted that
two types of cry are present at birth: rhythmical cry and pain cry (so called
because it is manifested in response to painful stimulation). Each is char
acterized by a distinctive breathing pattern in which expiration, inspira
tion, and the pauses between them all have a precise duration. Around the
second month, a qualitatively different type of cry appears, the irregular or
fussy cry, which becomes increasingly complicated during the first year of
life, with variations in vocal intensity, bilabial friction noises, and squeal
ing. Infants vary the auditory features of the cry depending on their goals
and on the caregiver’s responses to them. At nine months, the cry is less
persistent and more punctuated by pauses, during which the infant checks
the cry’s effects on the caregiver. Soon afterward the cry becomes incorpo
rated into a “demand behavior” that includes referential gestures of hands
and arms. In infants older than one year, crying begins and declines more
slowly, with more variations in the middle.


60 Chapter 3
Fogel and Thelen’s specific dynamical proposal is to view these changes
as induced by control parameters that themselves shift as the organism
develops and changes, and in response to the different behaviors that such
changes make possible, and that affect development in turn (recall that the
notion of control parameter does not imply a controller; “control param
eters” here refers to intervening factors that affect the way the system self
organizes). Changes in the respiratory apparatus, for example, can be seen as
control parameters for the appearance of fussy crying. Subsequent changes
in patterns of crying may be due to the development of the oral muscula
ture, itself dependent on experiences of feeding and oral exploration. The
development of speech articulators may be another source of change, while
itself being influenced by the infant’s linguistic context. Similarly for the
emergence of other skills, such as head turning, hand-to-mouth behavior
and kicking, joint attention, and responsiveness to the caregiver. These are
seen not as outputs of neural programs but as depending on the recipro
cal influences of brain, bodily, and environmental processes; they are con
strained by neural and muscular dynamics present at birth, but they change
as the organism grows, and as the infant’s interactional dynamics with the
environment, including other people, also change and develop.
These theoretical considerations have found some support more recently
in experimental work conducted by Linda Camras and colleagues, which
has shown that infant facial expressions of emotion can be assembled
dynamically from the realization of just one or a few of their components
(e.g., brow raise, open mouth), and they can also be shaped in different ways
by head lifts and tilts. Thus, for example, opening the mouth for oral explo
ration induces brow raising and eye widening, which are features of the sur
prise expression (Michel, Camras, and Sullivan 1992; Camras, Lambrecht,
and Michel 1996). Structural synergies of this kind also explain, in Camras’s
view, the frequent occurrence in infants of “unexpected” emotional facial
expressions, namely, expressions occurring in contexts where the corre
sponding emotion would ordinarily not be manifested (Camras 2000).
Note that like the component process model (CPM) we saw in the pre
vious chapter, this approach acknowledges the possibility that changes in
distinctive expressive features subserve specific functions; brow raising, for
example, may be related to the presence of a novel stimulus that requires
increased attention. Unlike the CPM, however, the dynamical approach


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 61
does not claim that each muscle movement is driven by a distinct appraisal
process. Rather, the rest of the face “takes care of itself,” so to speak, in
virtue of existing muscular constraints. It is important to emphasize the dif
ference between the dynamical and the component process approach here,
because the latter has sometimes also been presented as dynamical. Scherer
(2000) in particular uses various dynamical systems concepts to describe the
CPM, suggesting, for example, that the activity of the appraisal subsystem
can be seen as triggering processes of mutual constraints, entrainment, and
synchronization across the whole organism, and as directing the organism
toward a variety of attractors. Scherer and Ellgring (2007) similarly write
that, according to the CPM, “emotions have an emergent character based
on the interaction of different components driven by the appraisal of an
eliciting event” (115; italics in original), and “facial movements cumula
tively combine in a dynamic fashion” (117). In spite of these claims, how
ever, the CPM clearly inclines toward viewing all or most of the changes
occurring during an emotional episode as driven by appraisal processes and
thus does not leave room for genuine self-organization among the various
components of the emotion system. Pace its emphasis on the interactivity
of the various emotion subsystems, the CPM primarily aims to identify the
causal antecedents (in the form of stimulus evaluations checks or SECs; see
previous chapter) of all or most changes occurring in the organism in an
emotional episode. These causal antecedents determine, in a sequential and
piecemeal fashion (recall that the various SECs are supposed to follow one
another sequentially), the activity of the other emotional subsystems (auto
nomic arousal, expression, motor activity, etc.). These subsystems thus do
not really self-organize but obey the driving appraisal factor (see also the
next chapter). As Camras and Witherington (2005, 336) also comment, in
Scherer’s model “the appraisal component both sets in motion relations
with other components and responds to feedback from other components
in an effort to ‘guide’ adaptation to a given context. Thus, the appraisal
component of the system ends up assuming central executive properties; it
is not by any means an encapsulated central executive, but it does operate
as a monitoring system for the organization of other system.”
The difference in approach is also apparent in their chosen methodology
for the study of expression. According to Scherer, the main task is to identify
the SECs that guide individual muscle movements (action units). According


62 Chapter 3
to Camras, the study of the development of emotional behavior ought to
proceed following the method proposed by Thelen and Smith (1994). The
experimenters first need to establish which phenomena to describe with
collective variables. Then they need to identify which attractors character
ize the system’s behavior, map their evolution, and determine when the
system changes from one attractor to another. Then they need to identify
which factors may function as control parameters for the appearance and
evolution of the charted phenomena, and eventually verify their hypoth
esis via experimental manipulations (Camras and Witherington 2005).
Note that the view that an emotional expression is not dictated by an
affect program but is a coordinative structure need not apply only to infant
expressions. Adult expressions are more stable than infant ones, namely,
less variable and subject to perturbations. In dynamical systems terms, adult
expressions can be characterized as relatively recurrent and fixed patterns
whose specific shape has been carved in development as certain structures
occurred more frequently, thus establishing specific basins of attraction in
the topology of the “facial expression state space.” This implies, among
other things, that adult expressions remain open to modifications in the
rest of the organism that occur as life progresses, as well as to interactions
with others. Our organism does not stop changing as we reach adulthood,
and our facial expressions vary as a function of new muscular synergies. In
addition, as we will see in section 3.3.3 and in chapter 7, our expressivity is
largely influenced by our concrete interactions with others.
Also, the view that an emotional expression is not dictated by an affect
program but is rather a coordinative structure need not apply only to facial
expressions, either. Little research has been conducted on the rest of the
body, yet there are no reasons why dynamical systems principles could not
be applied beyond facial expressions—quite the contrary. Complex syner
gies characterize the somatic (musculoskeletal) system, and emotional epi
sodes are likely to entrain it into specific configurations that depend on
external as well as internal constraints. As more data are gathered about
bodily postures and gestures in emotion expression (it is only very recently
that affective scientists have begun to code the actions of the body; see
Dael, Mortillaro, and Scherer 2012), it may become possible to identify con
trol parameters that influence the structure and dynamics of the expressive
emotional body in context, and to plot the value of related collective vari
ables reflecting the mutual influences of different parts of the body.


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 63
3.3.2 Neural Self-Organization
Dynamical systems principles have also been used to account for the orga
nization as well as the development of neural systems underpinning emo
tion. One proposal, by Freeman (1999, 2000), is that evolutionarily older
structures in the limbic system typically associated with emotion are self
organizing and constitute the intentional core of the living organism.6 Free
man (2000, 214) actually identifies emotion with “the intention to act in
the near future.” Any analysis of the organism’s behavior, he argues, ought
to begin from this endogenous intentional activity, which motivates the
organism into action. Freeman contrasts this view, which he characterizes
as “activist-pragmatist,” with the “passivist-cognitivist” view, according to
which behavior is the output of a sequence of information-processing steps:
in the first step, sensory stimulation provides information that goes from
the sensory receptors to perceptual representations in the thalamus and
sensory cortex; from there it is transmitted to the frontal lobes and motor
cortex, where it is further processed before being passed on to the muscles
to initiate action. Freeman criticizes this account for failing to integrate the
activity of the limbic system into the process, which in his view is neces
sary to motivate action. Moreover, he rejects the sequential character of
this account, emphasizing instead that brain activity involves primarily
reciprocal influences between areas and processes that are complexly inter
connected. The entorhinal cortex in particular (a major part of the limbic
system) “not only receives and combines input from all of the primary sen
sory areas in the cerebral hemisphere; it also sends its output back again to
all of them, after its previous activity has been integrated over time in the
hippocampus” (2000, 221). From this perspective, it is misleading to see
sensory stimulation as the initial step of a sequence that leads to perception
and action; rather, sensory stimulation reaches a brain that is already moti
vated and action oriented and uses information about the world to modu
late motor activity relative to its intentional orientation. There is, strictly
speaking, no first cause in this process; rather, sensory stimulation impinges
on ongoing mutually influencing neural processes, modifying their trajec
tories. Emotion, in this account, is thus integral to both perception and
action. As goal-oriented intentionality, emotion involves premotor activity
corresponding to action preparation and sustains actual motor action as
this unfolds; at the same time, the ongoing character of emotion renders
perception always more or less salient relative to the brain’s intentionality.


64 Chapter 3
Emotion is not a distinct step in a perception-action sequence, or a distinct
representation added at some point to the sequence; emotion is rather an
inescapable, pervasive dimension of brain activity on which sensory infor
mation impinges and from which action progresses.
This account is consistent with the so-called dynamic sensorimotor
approach, which emphasizes the reciprocal constitution of action and per
ception (Hurley 1998; O’Regan and Noë 2001; Noë 2004). This approach
acknowledges the embodied and active nature of the mind, and in par
ticular it reconceptualizes perception in terms of embodied action. As Noë
(2004, 1) puts it, “Perception is a way of acting. ... It is something we do.”
The idea, in a nutshell, is that perception cannot be reduced to the repre
sentation of sensory information within dedicated brain areas (this is what
Freeman calls the “passivist-cognitivist” view). Rather, perception needs to
be understood in the context of the organism’s continuous active engage
ments with the world, and of its related “knowledge of sensorimotor con
tingencies.” This term refers to the implicit knowledge that the organism,
as embodied and active, possesses about how perception varies as a func
tion of movement (see O’Regan and Noë 2001). When moving forward, for
example, it expects that the optic flow pattern on the retina will expand; on
the contrary, when moving backward, it expects that the optic flow pattern
will contract (different perceptual modalities, such as touch and hearing,
are characterized by different contingency rules). According to the dynami
cal sensorimotor approach, sensory information thus impinges on an active
organism that is already furnished with knowledge and expectations about
how the world changes in relation to movement; perceiving is, then, better
characterized as the exercise of this practical knowledge, rather than the
representation of sensory information in a dedicated part of the brain.
Freeman’s account is not just consistent with this approach to percep
tion, however; it importantly complements and enriches it by underscor
ing its affective dimension. The dynamic sensorimotor approach does not
address either emotion or affectivity more generally; it portrays perception
as something that the organism does, but is silent about the affective-moti
vational dimension of this doing, in particular its endogenous intentional
orientation and, relatedly, the salient nature of percepts. In Freeman’s
account, on the other hand, emotion is explicitly embedded within the
sensorimotor activity of the organism and pervades it thoroughly.
Note, however, that, to use the terminology introduced so far, Free
man’s is best seen as a dynamical account of affectivity, and not of specific


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 65
emotional episodes. As such, it pertains only secondarily to our present con
cern, namely, the question of how to conceptualize the emotions. A more
relevant account here has been provided by Lewis (2005) and more recently
by Lewis and Liu (2011). According to Lewis (2005), an emotional episode
is a “cognition-emotion amalgam,” or better an emotional interpretation that
temporarily integrates neural processes widely distributed across the whole
brain. This integration takes place via different mechanisms involving
nonlinear influences among neural components, where “nonlinear influ
ences” include (i) reciprocal or recursive relations characterized by mul
tiple feedback cycles, such that cause–effect relations are multidirectional;
and (ii) cause–effect relations where effects do not follow from causes in a
linear way but “may be exponential, subject to threshold effects, and/or
sensitive to damping or amplifying effects from other system components”
(Lewis 2005, 173). The influences that Lewis mentions are positive feed
back (which occurs when a change in the activity of a component system
feeds back to it and amplifies the change), negative feedback (which occurs
when an excitatory influence from one component system to the other is
responded to with an inhibitory one, and stabilization or continuous oscil
lation ensues), entrainment of other systems into patterns of stability, and
circular causality between different levels of the same system. According to
Lewis, an emotional episode begins with a triggering event that initiates a
process of reciprocal influences between various neural systems subsuming
a variety of functions, such as attention, evaluation, bodily arousal, and
action tendencies. An initial phase of self-amplification through positive
feedback is followed by self-stabilization through negative feedback and
entrainment, which leads to an orderly, coherent, and complex large-scale
pattern corresponding, at the psychological level of description, to an emo
tional interpretation—namely, to a state that is at the same time a cognitive
interpretation of the personal significance of the triggering event, and an
emotional state. In sum, an emotional episode for Lewis corresponds to a
large-scale, self-organizing, complex process that constrains or “enslaves”
neural activity typically associated with cognitive and emotional processes
into a temporarily stable structure, via various types of nonlinear influences.
I will say more about Lewis’s (2005) account and the relationship
between cognition and emotion in the next chapter, where I discuss spe
cifically the notion of appraisal. For the moment, simply note the applica
tion of dynamical systems concepts at the level of neural self-organization
to describe the emergence of specific emotional episodes. This account is


66 Chapter 3
different from, but not incompatible with, Freeman’s. It can be seen as
providing a specific account of the “microdevelopment” of an emotional
episode within the broader superordinate context of endogenous inten
tionality that Freeman talks about (see also Thompson 2007, chap. 12).
The most relevant neurodynamical approach to emotion for present pur
poses is a recent paper by Lewis and Liu (2011), which explicitly addresses
the debate between BET and the constructionist/conceptual act approach
we saw earlier in the book. Lewis and Liu offer an account specifically of
the development of brain structures underpinning different emotions. In
their view, emotions, including BET’s basic ones, are neither underpinned
by “prespecified structures” nor entirely constructed psychologically or via
conceptual acts. Rather, all emotions (i.e., the basic and nonbasic ones; note
that Lewis and Liu do not drop the distinction) are subsumed by neural
structures whose ontogenetic unfolding is shaped by forces that operate at
different timescales. Hence the newborn brain is furnished with a few sys
tems implementing primitive emotional functions, resulting from selective
pressures at the evolutionary scale. Importantly, these systems are not rigid
modules but open, flexible structures influenced by organism-environment
encounters. As the infant interacts with the environment (including active
and responsive others), the process of exponential synaptic growing (syn
aptogenesis) that occurs early in development is accompanied by a process
of synaptic pruning in which some neural associations are established at
the expense of others, fostering the relative stabilization of some emotional
responses over time.7 Caregivers significantly contribute to this process
by encouraging certain responses and deterring others; social norms and
encounters with other people further contribute to consolidating some
emotional habits and brain structures with them. Eventually, an individual
emotional episode is thus underpinned by a neural pattern whose shape is
influenced by the local context, as well as having been molded by evolu
tionary and developmental forces.
3.3.3 Interpersonal Dynamics
Yet another domain of emotion theory to which dynamical systems prin
ciples have been applied is interpersonal relations. As we saw, in their
discussion of crying and smiling, Fogel and Thelen (1987) already hinted
at the role that interacting with others has on emotion expression. Pat
terns of crying, for example, change during the first year of life as infants
develop the capacity to track the caregiver’s responses to them. Crying also


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 67
becomes incorporated into a more general “demand behavior” in which its
various aspects are coordinated with other behaviors to obtain a response
from the caregiver. On the basis of these and similar considerations, Fogel
et al. (1992) proposed a “social process theory” of emotion in which they
particularly emphasized the role of social context in shaping and organiz
ing the emotional responses of infants. In later work, Fogel and colleagues
have applied dynamical systems concepts to mother-infant interactions,
identifying different patterns of dyadic coordination and their dependence
on previous interactions (see Hsu and Fogel 2003; Lavelli and Fogel 2005).
Most relevant for present purposes, in their study of smiles in six- to twelve
month-olds, Fogel et al. (2006) describe how different types of smiles are
produced in different contexts, including interactions with different peo
ple. Four different types of smile are identified: simple smiles, with raised lip
corners and no other facial action; BET’s prototypical Duchenne smiles, with
raised lip corners and raised cheeks; play smiles, characterized by a dropped
jaw and also called “open mouth smile” or “gaping smile”; and so-called
duplay smiles, involving raised lip corners, raised cheeks, and dropped jaw.
Most smiles in the first weeks of age are endogenous; that is, they occur
primarily during REM sleep and during transitions from waking to sleep.
Smiles in social interactions appear at about two months, together with
the ability to maintain eye contact and visual attention for a longer time.
Between two and six months, different smiles appear in relation to various
forms of sensory stimulation and in different contexts. Duchenne smiles,
for example, are more likely than non-Duchenne smiles when mothers
smile at infants, in speechlike nondistress vocalizations, and when infants
gaze at their mothers in face-to-face play. After ten months, Duchenne
smiles are more likely when infants greet their mothers after a brief separa
tion, and non-Duchenne smiles more likely when they greet strangers. In
addition, Fogel et al. found that infant smiles differ in kind, duration, and
amplitude in different social games (tickle versus peekaboo), and in differ
ent phases of the games (setup versus climax). They conclude that simple
smiles, Duchenne smiles, and duplay smiles have different functions, with
simple smiles reflecting a background of enjoyment and maintaining the
participants’ mutual engagement, and Duchenne and duplay smiles reflect
ing an experience of buildup and completion of shared participation.
This work interestingly suggests a process of mutual coregulation and
emotional attunement between infant and mother, in which the expression
of emotion plays an important role in communicating and maintaining


68 Chapter 3
reciprocal engagement. In particular, in the mother-infant interaction,
emotional expression in each interactant appears to be subtly dependent
on the other’s expression, such that we may consider the dyad a coupled
system.8 Fogel et al. (2006, 472) even claim that “rather than viewing each
person’s emotion as ... separate from each other, [dynamical systems the
ory] suggests that the other person’s action is one component of emotion,
which ‘belongs’ to the relationship system and not just the system within
the skin boundary of the individual alone.” From this perspective, emo
tional episodes can span two or even more organisms (see also Krueger,
forthcoming, for the suggestion that emotions, in some cases at least, can
be seen as “socially extended”).
Granic (2000) similarly emphasizes that parent-child relations are best
characterized by continuous reciprocal influences that lead to recurrent pat
terns of interaction that are difficult to undo once stabilized. This process is
not driven by any one of the individuals involved but rather self-organizes
as individuals respond to one another moment by moment and gradually
sculpt a landscape of preferred modes of interaction. Aggressive parent
child relations, Granic argues, provide a good illustration of this process.
These relations manifest recurrent patterns of reciprocal hostility (“coercive
attractors”) into which participants are “pulled,” often without conscious
intention or control. Such patterns are gradually carved in the course of
several interactions over time. A mother prone to depression, for example,
is more likely to appraise her child as particularly difficult or obstructive
and to intrude in the child’s behavior with frequent criticisms and disap
provals (Patterson 1982). This attitude in turn is likely to induce defensive
and uncooperative behavior in the child, including aggressive attitudes
such as yelling and arguing; the child is also likely to evaluate the mother as
uncooperative and obstructive. The outcome is a complementary relation
ship in which each partner is a source of anger and frustration for the other,
and the target of aggressive behavior. Importantly, these patterns are not
deliberately established by the participants; rather, they take the forms they
have in virtue of moment-to-moment affective-behavioral reciprocities that
lead to the establishment of relational structures in which participants are,
as they themselves report, out of control. Patterson (1982) observes that
many of the parents of aggressive parent-child dyads are otherwise mild
mannered and nonaggressive and are themselves puzzled by the hostility
they display toward their children, which often includes aggressive shout
ing and physical beating (see Granic 2000).


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 69
From a dynamical systems perspective, however, one should also keep in
mind that coupled systems such as parent-child dyads and spouses remain
open and context dependent; the way the parts of these systems influ
ence one another always depends on a variety of factors inside and outside
them, and thus changes can always occur that will modify their coupling.
Laible and Thompson (2000) argue that to explain the development of an
infant’s emotional style uniquely in terms of her relation to the primary
caregiver, as attachment theory does, for example, is restrictive. Attach
ment theory notably explains the development of secure and insecure pat
terns of attachment primarily with reference to the mother’s sensitivity
and responsiveness to the infant. As Laible and Thompson point out, the
idea that different patterns of behavior form as a consequence of previous
interactions, and indeed that their development is constrained by them, is
very much consistent with a dynamical systems approach. However, from
the dynamical systems point of view, various factors beyond the primary
caregiver can act as control parameters, such as other family members and
affectively salient people. Moreover, these factors are themselves change
able; they vary over time, thus contributing to shifting modalities and
styles of interpersonal coupling. This dynamical perspective importantly
appears to fit the data better than merely dyadic attachment models. As
Laible and Thompson point out, there is mixed evidence for the claim that
the style of early mother-infant interactions predicts specific patterns of
attachment; rather, attachment security appears to vary as family circum
stances do. More empirical research is needed, however, to establish more
precisely how factors other than the relationship to the primary caregiver
affect attachment styles.
3.3.4 In Sum: Dynamical Emotional Episodes
The accounts just presented differ primarily in that they apply at very differ
ent levels of description of the organism—from neural structures, to facial
and bodily expressions, to interpersonal relations. Yet overall they provide, I
believe, a distinctive and coherent conceptualization of emotional episodes.
Putting their insights together and drawing on the terminology introduced
earlier, we can recapitulate by saying that, from a dynamical systems per
spective, emotional episodes correspond to specific self-organizing forms or
second-order constraints—emotion forms, as I shall call them—that recruit
or entrain various processes (neural, muscular, autonomic, etc.) into highly
integrated configurations or patterns. Reciprocal interactions among these


70 Chapter 3
various processes correspond to first-order constraints. Events in the organ
ism and environment can influence the self-organization of the emotion
form by acting as control parameters, although precisely which events play
this role, and in which context, is not known (yet). Importantly, an organ
ism can become coupled to another one (or other ones) via continuous
reciprocal influences. In this case, we can talk of emotion forms instanti
ated by two (or more) organisms together in their coupling, with attractors
that pull all organisms simultaneously into a specific interactive pattern.
Emotional episodes thus conceptualized can be highly variable, because
the processes constituting them can organize themselves in different ways
(by analogy, the convection rolls appearing in the Rayleigh-Bénard instabil
ity can vary in how the liquid’s molecules organize themselves; the human
organism is, of course, more complex and thus has many more possibili
ties of self-organization). Yet at the same time, the range of their possible
variations is constrained by the topology of the state space, which is both
evolutionarily and developmentally shaped. Regions of stability (attractors)
within the state space pull variously constituted emotion forms toward or
away from them. The presence of these regions guarantees relative stability
in spite of variations, and the capacity of various processes (neural, mus
cular, etc.) to influence and constrain one another allows stability to be
achieved in various ways.
3.4 Implications for the Debate on the Nature of the Emotions
This conceptualization has various implications for the debate on the
nature of the emotions that we considered in the previous chapter. For one,
it makes the notion of an internal affect program for coordinated responses
redundant.9 Dynamical emotion forms exhibit distinctive configurations
not because they are outputs of internal instructions but because they result
from a history of mutual influences between evolutionary and develop
mental factors that shape the organism in a certain way. As a bonus, this
view makes all emotional episodes, including those usually associated with
basic emotions, into open and flexible structures sensitive to local condi
tions, which naturally accounts for their variability and context depen
dence; there is no need in this view to posit acquired display rules for each
deviation from BET’s prototypical expressions. The variability found in
infant expressions, especially very young ones who would not have had


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 71
the chance to acquire display rules yet, is clearly a problem for BET. Yet
even in adult expressions, it is more natural to posit emotional systems
that are flexible from the beginning, rather than adding several ad hoc
rules for each variant expression, neural or autonomic pattern, or behavior.
Likewise, a dynamical conceptualization does not require each aspect of
the emotional episode to be driven by a distinct appraisal process (as in
the component process model). It does not necessarily reject the view that
the brain and bodily processes recruited in emotional episodes may have
specific functions (e.g., detecting novelty in the environment, preparing
to attack), but it does not imply that this ought to be the case for all the
components of an emotional episode, and that all these components must
be preceded by a dedicated appraisal check. More in line with principles
of physiological organization, it posits that existing physical constraints
among components contribute to the form of emotional episodes, such
that these components are not individually “led” or “driven” but collec
tively channeled into a specific pattern.
Another important aspect of this conceptualization is that it does not
deny that biology plays a role in shaping emotion forms, and therefore it
does not suffer from the difficulties of the psychological constructionist
models highlighted in the previous chapter. Dynamical emotional episodes
are not outputs of genetically determined affect programs, but this does not
mean that genetic factors play no part in their formation. Rather, the idea
is that genes are just some of the causal factors that contribute to shaping
emotion forms over time. The ontogeny of the “emotional topology” of
the organism is affected by genetic as well as environmental constraints.
Genes contribute to setting up such a topology always in interaction with
other factors variously distributed over brain, body, and world. We are far
from being able to understand more specifically what makes certain emo
tional manifestations more stable across cultures than others; however, for
present purposes, the aim is just to emphasize that a dynamical systems
perspective enables a characterization of emotional episodes that does not
force them into being either outputs of genetically determined programs or
acts of categorization driven by linguistic concepts unrelated to our biologi
cal organization.10
What about the very notion of “basic” emotions? The suggested dynam
ical conceptualization applies to all emotional episodes and so does not
draw a clear-cut division between basic and nonbasic emotions: according


72 Chapter 3
to it, all emotions come in complex organismic patterns subject to both
evolutionary and developmental pressures. In this sense, this view can thus
be seen as entailing a version of the unity thesis, although importantly not
a building-block one. According to it, in fact, emotional episodes are whole
organismic patterns and as such do not contain other emotional episodes
as parts. Thus, for example, an episode of jealousy comes as a whole (open
and flexible) organismic form and does not contain within itself a differ
ent emotional episode, such as anger. An episode of jealousy may lead to
one of anger, and vice versa, and overlap partially with it in the sense that
some of the neural, autonomic, and expressive processes constituting an
episode of jealousy may also be recruited in the same organism during an
episode of anger. Yet the overall form of an episode of jealousy will entrain
the organism in a different pattern from an episode of anger and will thus
not be reducible to an episode of anger (or some other emotion) “plus”
something else. From the present dynamical perspective, it is thus possible
for two or more emotions to blend and form mixtures of various kinds, but
only by being integrated into a new form that is not a linear sum of differ
ent emotion forms.
Rejecting the building-block approach does not imply that looking for
cross-cultural and culture-specific emotional manifestations is not a valid
research enterprise. Quite the contrary, from a dynamical systems perspec
tive, it is interesting to investigate whether certain configurations remain
stable or robust across cultures, including when and in which contexts
they appear in development, and the range of variations they exhibit (if
they do), including whether recurrent variations depend on specific con
trol parameters. Importantly, however, this investigation would not have
to be restricted to a small number of emotions. Rather, it would be part of
a broad research program aiming to explore the facial and bodily expres
sion of a large number of emotions across cultures, with no prejudice that
only some emotions will be found to be manifested in similar ways across
cultures. At the same time, from a dynamical systems perspective, it would
also be interesting to look for culture-specific or even individual differences
in emotion expression, with the specific intent of identifying the relevant
patterns, their context and developmental trajectory, and the extent to
which they can be seen as either culture-specific modifications of the pan
cultural expressions or entirely novel configurations. This research program
(which is very much like the one Darwin began almost a century and a
half ago) could also be accompanied by an investigation into the functions


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 73
of specific emotional manifestations and their components, keeping in
mind, however, the capacity of context to influence and even modify these
functions.
This account is to some extent consistent with Jason Clark’s (2010)
recent proposal to view the “higher cognitive emotions” as homologous
with the basic ones. Clark takes issue with Griffiths’s (1997) disunity the
sis, according to which, as we saw, affect programs and higher cognitive
emotions belong to two distinct natural kinds, evolved separately, with dif
ferent functions and recruiting different structures. Clark, rather, proposes
that higher cognitive emotions are united with basic emotions in a pattern
of ancestry and descent (i.e., the same way in which human arms are united
with other vertebrate limbs, including bats’ wings and seals’ flippers). He
also proposes seeing higher cognitive emotions as modifications of basic
mechanisms to adapt to increasingly complex environments: “As environ
ments (especially social environments) become more complex and variable
through evolution and development, emotions must keep pace. Simply
possessing a set of stereotyped responses to a limited range of stimuli (while
still essential in some situations) is no longer a feasible option” (J. Clark
2010, 89).
He illustrates this point with the detailed discussion of one emotion,
shame. He argues first against the widespread view that shame, as a “pure”
higher cognitive emotion, has no characteristic physiology and expression
and is present only in humans. Rather, he maintains that human shame in
its present form has emerged from a rank-related emotion in nonhuman
mammals, whose primary function was to signal subordinance to a domi
nant other so as to appease him (see also, e.g., Fessler 2007; Gilbert 2007).
Importantly, evidence indicates that this emotion has characteristic expres
sive and behavioral features such as shrinking posture, gaze aversion, avoid
ing social contact, and hiding (e.g., Fessler 2007), as well as characteristic
patterned physiological (Gruenewald, Dickerson, and Kemeny 2007) and
neural (e.g., J. Beer 2007) activity. Second, Clark points out that this form
of shame (basic shame, as he calls it) appears to be retained in humans; in
particular, autonomic activity seems to be largely the same (e.g., Dickerson,
Gruenewald, and Kemeny 2004). However, its functional breadth is wider.
For one, in contemporary societies characterized by “prestige hierarchies,”
shame is associated with loss of prestige (rather than of physical dominance)
in competitions for positive social attention and socially valued traits and
possessions. Also, it has acquired the function of facilitating cooperation by


74 Chapter 3
signaling awareness of the violation of norms and the desire to adhere to
them. Clark ultimately suggests that we view the basic form of shame as a
precursor of human shame, where human shame has retained many of the
traits of basic shame but has also acquired different (yet related) functions,
in virtue of the increasing sociocognitive complexities of humans. Human
shame is thus not an entirely new and different emotion from its basic form
but is continuous with it. Precisely what kind of homology exists between
the two forms of shame, Clark specifies, is not possible to say in light of
existing evidence. One possibility is that human shame is a more complex
version of basic shame that has entirely replaced the earlier form and thus
become the only form of shame present in humans (single-trait homology).
Another possibility is that basic and more complex forms of shame coexist
in humans; in particular, basic shame is retained within modular structures,
whereas more complex shame recruits cognitive resources (serial homology).
Clark’s general suggestion that complex emotions are homologous with
basic ones is largely consistent with the dynamical conceptualization pro
posed here, because it posits unity among emotions without adopting a
building-block view and acknowledges the plasticity of basic emotions
(though it retains the construct), as well as the power of the environment
to mold these basic emotions into different ones that retain basic features
while also adapting to new contexts and developing new functions. The
two views differ, however, in that the dynamical perspective predicts that
human emotional episodes will manifest a broader spectrum of variability
than the one Clark seems willing to acknowledge (based on existing evi
dence). If it is the case, as Clark himself suggests, that as the environment
becomes more complex, the emotions must keep pace, then the dynami
cal prediction is that they will become more complex not just in function
but in appearance, so to speak, namely, in their neural, behavioral, and
bodily manifestations. Thus one is likely to find forms of shame in humans
that not only have broader functionality than homologous states in other
mammals but also show larger variability in terms of facial expressions,
neural concomitants, autonomic changes, and so on—as well as a sensi
tivity toward a wider and more complex range of stimuli. The extent to
which shame comes in different forms in humans, and the extent to which
one can find homologies across mammals, cross-cultural similarities, and
culture-specific differences in manifestations of shame, are all empirical
questions that still need to be addressed.


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 75
3.5 Discreteness and Boundaries
The dynamical characterization of emotional episodes proposed earlier has
implications also for the notion of discrete emotions. This label is widely
used in affective science but is not clearly defined. Basic emotions are often
characterized as discrete (indeed, the phrase “discrete emotion theory” is
often used interchangeably with “basic emotion theory”) to emphasize
that basic emotions are “distinct” or “separate” from one another.11 What
exactly this means, however, is not clear. Discrete emotion accounts are
sometimes contrasted with dimensional accounts, according to which all
the emotions have something in common; namely, they all vary along
the same dimensions, such as valence and arousal (as in Russell’s and Bar
rett’s models; see chap. 2). However, this contrast is misleading, because
BET does not deny that basic emotions vary in valence and arousal; recall,
for example, that Tomkins (1962) divided his affect programs into positive
and negative ones and acknowledged that each of them varies in intensity.
On the other hand, dimensional theorists do not deny that emotions dif
fer from one another; recall, for example, that Russell (2003) listed other
components of emotion besides core affect.12 In addition, a closer look at
BET reveals that its basic emotions are not discrete in the sense of being
entirely separate from one another. Only the affect programs appear to be
nonoverlapping (if we think of them as sets of internal rules for the genera
tion of patterned responses). Yet the outputs of such programs are shared
between different basic emotions. For example, in the case of facial expres
sions, in BET activation of action unit 4 (the brow lowerer) is considered
part of the prototypical expressions of anger, sadness, and fear; similarly,
the activation of action unit 5 (the upper lid raiser) is considered part of the
prototypical expressions of both fear and anger (Ekman and Friesen 1978).
Although it is true that, as Scherer and Ellgring (2007) emphasize, BET
predicts that some facial expressions will come in “tight packages” with
minimal overlap, BET does not predict total separateness. This is even more
apparent in the case of autonomic activity, where basic emotion theorists
look for specific directions and magnitudes of the same dimensions of auto
nomic arousal, such as skin conductance, skin temperature, heart rate, and
so on (see, e.g., Matsumoto and Ekman 2009, 71: “Anger, for instance, pro
duces vasodilation, pupil constriction, foaming, and piloerection. ... Fear,
however, produces vasoconstriction, pupil dilation, and bulging eyes”; see


76 Chapter 3
also Levenson 2003). In other words, they look at the autonomic system
as a whole complex system and are interested in whether or not, as such a
whole, it behaves differently for each affect program. Finally, neuroscien
tists sympathetic to BET do not see the neural circuits of basic emotions as
nonoverlapping, either. Notably, according to Panksepp (e.g., 1998a, 2005,
2007), basic emotional systems are associated with distinctive complex
patterns of neural and chemical activity; these neurochemical patterns, as
Panksepp (2007, 288) claims, are “distinct,” though “neural diversities do
not mean that many brain emotional action systems do not share some
common arousal functions. Clearly, brain norepinephrine and serotonin
systems influence every emotion.” Panksepp (2005, 33) also reports a table
representing global neurochemical dynamics that, he claims, characterize
all basic emotional systems.
From a dynamical systems perspective, every emotional episode is
a mode of self-organization of the whole organism (an emotion form,
as defined earlier). Some recur more often and robustly than others and
exhibit a small range of variations; other forms recur reliably only in some
cultures or even individuals; still other forms emerge only on a few occa
sions. So in the sense that emotional episodes differ from one another, they
can be seen as “discrete.” But otherwise there is no expectation that all
emotional episodes are classifiable as instances of more or less universally
or culturally recognized categories; some are, but some may well not be
rather, some will be idiosyncratic, messy-looking patterns with their own
irreducible form, at times reminiscent of more familiar configurations, at
other times definitely strange.
What about the boundaries of emotional episodes? As mentioned
in chapter 2, affect programs in BET are initiated by automatic apprais
als that mark the beginning of an emotional episode, which is typically
short-lived and lasts as long as the various processes making it up occur.
Emotional episodes thus have a clear beginning and end. From the present
dynamical systems perspective, it is also possible to identify with relative
precision when a certain emotional episode begins or ends: specific events
may induce rapid shifts in the state space, with a quick entrainment of
the organism into an emotion form; likewise, emotion forms may be rap
idly undone. Other episodes, however, may involve a slower process, with
emotion forms emerging and dissolving gradually (think of irritation that
builds up during the day, or of anger that lingers on even after its cause has
been modified or removed).


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 77
If we return to the broader framework of enactivism, we can add that,
from an enactive perspective, emotional episodes as dynamical patterns
should not be seen as forming against an otherwise nonaffective back
ground (as seemingly implied by BET). The proposal, rather, is to view emo
tional episodes as coherent patterns of an organism that is always already
affective in virtue of its being a sense-making system, as discussed in chap
ter 1. Emotional episodes as characterized here are instantiations of such
sense-making activity, where the organism self-organizes into this or that
emotion form. To the extent that these emotion forms can be identified
and distinguished from one another, we can consider them “discrete.” Yet
between them, so to speak, the organism remains affectively engaged.
3.6 Moods
The question of the boundaries of emotional episodes is also related to
the question of the relationship between emotions and moods. We saw in
chapter 1 that affective scientists do not draw a clear or sharp distinction
between the two; they conceive of moods generally as less intense and lon
ger lasting than emotions. We can now consider this claim more closely.
Intensity is not, I think, particularly useful for distinguishing between
emotions and moods. Emotional episodes vary considerably in intensity,
ranging from the mild to the overpowering, across and within emotion cat
egories; likewise for moods. Certainly not all emotional episodes are intense,
and not all moods are mild; one can be moderately amused or annoyed at
something, as well as overwhelmingly anxious for a long time. Duration
strikes me as a comparatively better marker of the difference between emo
tions and moods. In particular, it seems important to distinguish between
short-lived episodes that involve rapid changes in a variety of brain and
bodily processes, and more persistent conditions. What we call moods tend
to refer to longer-lasting conditions rather than comparatively short-lived
episodes; true, emotional episodes can vary in duration (compare a short
lived episode of disgust at the sight or smell of vomit with an episode of
anger during a quarrel), but we do not usually say that one has the blues or
is depressed only for just a minute or so.
The relationship between emotions and moods is not completely cap
tured in terms of a difference in duration, however. What is also impor
tant is that moods appear to facilitate some emotional episodes more than
others, and conversely that the recurrence of certain emotional episodes


78 Chapter 3
appears to induce shifts in mood. When one is cranky, for example, one is
more likely to burst out at others with anger; or when one is anxious, one
is more likely to be frightened by events that would not normally have this
effect. On the other hand, reiterated episodes of fear can increase one’s
wariness and lead to sustained anxiety.
A dynamical systems approach has the conceptual resources to make
sense of these interdependencies. As discussed so far, we can think of emo
tional episodes as rapidly forming emergent patterns of the organism that
last for a few seconds or minutes. Changes from one emotional episode to
another can be seen as shifts of the organism from one attractor to another.
Moods can also be seen as emergent organismic patterns, but as more per
sistent ones, lasting for hours, days, or even weeks. Note that like emotional
episodes, moods appear to exhibit distinctive organismic features. Some of
them are familiar and observable in everyday attitudes; someone in a cheer
ful mood, for example, usually smiles and laughs more than someone in a
grumpy mood, whereas someone in a grumpy mood tends to frown and
pout more. In addition, empirical evidence indicates that different moods
come with different neural and autonomic patterns of activity (Thayer
1989); we know from the rapidly developing field of psychopharmacology
that mood disorders such as depression and anxiety are characterized by
neurochemical activity that can be modified by specific drugs (e.g., Nem
eroff 1998).13 The suggestion is to think of moods as relatively persistent
organismic patterns—mood forms, as we may call them—that affect not just
the state of the organism at a given time but the kinds of emotional episodes
it is likely to enact. Dynamically speaking, we can say that moods make
some emotional episodes more likely than others by affecting the topol
ogy of the organism’s state space. Changes in moods shift the landscape of
attractors and repellors, pulling or “enslaving” brain and bodily processes
more toward certain emotion forms than others. Conversely, the reitera
tion of certain emotion forms can carve a topology that leads to the relative
stabilization of certain mood forms.14 It is useful to think of the relation
ship between moods and emotional episodes as analogous to that between
climate zones and weather. A climate zone (e.g., tropical, humid continen
tal, Mediterranean) is a complex system characterized by distinctive condi
tions (such as average temperature, rainfall, humidity) that remain stable
over time. Different climate zones are characterized by different weather,
namely, short-lived manifestations of specific conditions. Climate zones


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 79
are longer lived and set up the conditions for different weather patterns;
in particular, some weather phenomena are possible only within certain
climate zones and impossible in others (e.g., tropical cyclones develop in
tropical regions and not in deserts). On the other hand, the reiteration of
certain weather patterns may induce shifts in the climate zone, especially
when in conjunction with changes taking place outside the climate zone
itself (e.g., recurrent higher rainfalls may change a dry zone into a humid
one). Likewise, we can conceive of moods as setting up the conditions for
different emotion forms; some emotional episodes typically take place in
the context of certain moods rather than others (e.g., a bout of enthusiasm
typically takes place in a cheerful rather than grumpy mood). On the other
hand, the reiteration of certain emotional episodes may lead to a differ
ent mood, especially when in conjunction with changes in the organism’s
environment; for example, repeated episodes of sadness and disappoint
ment may lead to a depressive mood, especially in conjunction with an
unsupportive environment. The analogy can be taken only so far, of course,
and we should not stipulate a priori that certain moods make certain emo
tional episodes impossible, or that a certain emotional episode cannot ever
occur unless one is in a certain mood. However, I think the analogy is use
ful to illustrate the dynamical reciprocities among phenomena affecting
the same system but occurring at different timescales.15
Another way of drawing the distinction between emotions and moods
that is more common in philosophy refers to their intentionality, namely,
their capacity to intend, refer to, or be about objects or events in the world.
According to some philosophers, the main difference between emotions
and moods is that only emotions are intentional states, whereas moods are
not about anything. Anger, for example, is typically directed at a specific
object (e.g., a colleague’s offensive remark), but one does not feel cranky or
low about anything (see, e.g., De Sousa 1987). Other philosophers do not
deny that moods are intentional, but they take their objects to be general or
nonspecific—such as “everything,” “one’s whole life,” or “the world” (see
Solomon 2007; Goldie 2000; Ben-Ze’ev 2010). For Solomon (2007, 42), for
example, depression involves “a global attitude to the world,” in which one
“is depressed, not just about something but about everything.”
I think it is true that emotions and moods differ in their intentional
character, and emotions in particular are about specific objects.16 How
ever, I do not think that moods are adequately described as being either


80 Chapter 3
nonintentional or about general objects. To say that they are not about
anything seems to reduce them to a sort of self-enclosed, isolated subjective
condition detached from the world. Yet when I am cheerful, for example,
I am not in a “free-floating” feeling state, oblivious to the world. Rather,
my cheerfulness seems better characterized as involving a specific mode
of experiencing various events. We may say that in cheerfulness, aspects
of the world appear in a cheerful light, or that I bathe in cheerful happen
ings, so to speak, such that my cheerfulness and their cheerfulness are not
distinguished in experience (likewise for the warmth of my skin and the
warmth of the water when I am immersed in a bath). Similarly for “darker”
moods, such as gloom or grief, where it may be more tempting to claim
that the experience is isolated or self-enclosed. Clinically depressed people
notably report feeling alienated, isolated, and cut off from the world; this
experience is often accompanied by an exaggerated attention toward one’s
bodily sensations (Fuchs 2005). Yet arguably even in these cases the world
keeps looming. The depressive’s exaggerated attention to and concern for
her body do not appear to involve an absolute lack of world directedness.
Rather, such a focus appears to come with an alteration in the ordinary way
of experiencing the world. In particular, the world, including other people,
is not experienced as affording possibilities for action and affective con
nectedness with others anymore; it is experienced as further removed from
oneself, unreachable and alien. Depressed people also often complain of a
sense of suffocation, of being cut off from the world, while at the same time
they retain a sense that other people are not affected in the same way (for
more details, see Ratcliffe 2008, 61–63; 2009).
Should we say, then, that moods are about general rather than specific
objects? I find it hard to make sense of the notion of a general intentional
object. How can an experience be about “everything” or “the world”? It
does not seem possible for an experience to refer at once to all objects or
events in the world. The source of the difficulty, it seems to me, is the
assumption that to be intentional, an experience has to be object directed.
Given this assumption, if one wants to deny that moods are about specific
objects without denying that they are intentional, the only option is to say
that moods are about nonspecific, that is, general, objects.
A way around this is to say that moods are intentional not in the narrow
sense that they target objects but in the broader sense that they are “open”
to the world. This broader sense of intentionality does not usually feature


Emotional Episodes as Dynamical Patterns 81
in analytic philosophical accounts but has been recognized and elaborated
in phenomenology. Husserl notably identified a non-object-oriented form
of intentionality, which he called “operative intentionality” (fungierende
Intentionalität) and characterized as a broad “openness” toward otherness
(see Thompson and Zahavi 2007). This concept was taken up by Merleau
Ponty ([1945] 1962), who in the preface to his Phenomenology of Percep
tion portrayed it as an “enlarged notion” of intentionality, at work in our
desires, evaluations, and “landscape” of consciousness before intentional
acts are directed toward specific objects. Moods can be seen as intentional
in this “operative” way, as conscious states that do not intend objects but
are open to the world before any object-directed intentional act.
Interestingly, Husserl himself discussed the intentionality of moods in
unpublished manuscripts, where he portrayed moods as having an “unclear
intentionality” and yet as playing a decisive role in the constitution of
objects in experience, by disclosing or “illuminating” the world in the first
place (see N. Lee 1998, 114–118). This work may well have influenced Hei
degger’s ([1926] 1996) account of mood, according to which, as we saw,
moods are fundamental modes of existence that disclose one’s embedded
ness in the world, indeed, that make it possible in the first place to direct
oneself toward anything in particular. Heidegger’s view has been taken up
more recently by Ratcliffe (2008) in his account of what he calls existen
tial feelings, namely, “background feelings” that present the lived world to
the experiencing subject in one way or the other—as familiar, inhospita
ble, empty of possibilities, uncanny, and so on. Like Heideggerian moods,
existential feelings are not object directed (Ratcliffe calls them “pre-inten
tional”) but rather backdrop experiences against which specific intentional
states such as emotions take place, and which make emotions possible in
the first place. As Ratcliffe (2010) also puts it, existential feelings, as back
ground conditions of possibility for specific object-directed emotions, are
“deeper” than the specific emotions.
I see the present suggestion to conceptualize moods as topologies that
make some emotional episodes more likely than others as complement
ing these phenomenological considerations. In particular, however, this
suggestion needs to be placed back in the broader context of the enactive
approach and the notion of sense making introduced in chapter 1. From an
enactive perspective, even deeper than moods and existential feelings is the
sense-making activity of the organism, its primordial affectivity in virtue
