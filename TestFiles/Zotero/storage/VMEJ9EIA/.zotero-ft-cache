Abstract

Methodology and research supporting coaching’s effectiveness has not kept up with its growth and demand. The current literature on coaching is lacking sufficient empirical rigour and does not meet the standard required for mixed methods design. This meta-analysis investigated the outcomes of coaching, and potential moderating effects of other factors, using only randomised control trial studies. Outcomes studied included performance, well-being, coping, work attitudes, and goal-directed self-regulation. There were no moderating effects identified from participant age, type of measure, or author(s). The results showed that overall coaching has a moderate significant positive effect on coachees, p̂ = 0.42, which indicated that coaching is effective for individuals.
