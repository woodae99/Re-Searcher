**Part of the UNC - all things related to experience, what generates it, how it is known and how it is the product of what is as well as what arises within awareness when it is conscious**

Experience is self-evident of consciousness. What is conscious is also experience. What is experience, generated by the presence of the thing that is alive, whatever it's form may be is what appears within awareness. Awareness is not *aware of* as in the subject-object relationship, it is aware of the subjective content, the objective content and the relational and contextual content, too. What appears actual and what possible etc.

Consciousness is the source of experience. The contents of consciousness are not consciousness, nor are the conscious - they are known by consciousness. Experience is generated by the total make-up of the person (or other being) within their environment, within the context of history etc. Whatever is generated by the person arises within consciousness, but what is conscious is not other than the thing from which experience arises.
