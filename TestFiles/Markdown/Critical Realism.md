## Notes on CR

According to Bhaskar, adopting critical realism can have transformative effects. What can I use to inform my proposed transformative effects>

Some notes from scite:
Critical realism is a philosophical framework that seeks to explain the relationship between the natural and social worlds. It posits that there are three interrelated domains of reality: the empirical, the actual, and the real. The empirical domain is the world of observable phenomena, while the actual domain is the world of events and processes that generate those phenomena. The real domain is the underlying structures and mechanisms that generate the events and processes in the actual domain. Critical realism emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying structures and mechanisms that generate social phenomena, rather than simply describing or interpreting those phenomena [1](#^656fe7). Semiosis refers to the process of creating meaning through signs and symbols. According to critical realism, semiosis is an important part of social reality, but it is not the only part. Social reality also includes social factors that are independent of discourse, as well as discourse reality, which is constructed through discourse. While critical realism has been criticized for not having an adequate theory of signs and semiosis, it remains an important framework for understanding the relationship between language, meaning, and social reality [2][8]. Critical realism has been applied in a variety of fields, including strategy research, psychotherapy, nursing research, and educational research. It has been praised for its ability to provide a qualitative theory of causality that avoids the pitfalls of empiricist theories of causality, and for its potential to support eclecticism and integration in practice. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of attention to semiosis and its limited use in certain fields, such as educational leadership and management research [1][3][4][5][9][10].

Critical realism has been praised for its ability to provide a qualitative theory of causality that avoids the pitfalls of empiricist theories of causality. Empiricist theories of causality rely solely on quantitative research and equate causality with variance theory. This leaves causal processes locked in a metaphoric black box between cause and effect, whereas qualitative research opens up the processes and mechanisms contained within the box [11][13]. Critical realism allows for the qualitative and quantitative investigation of causal queries based on constructing a causal graph that represents the causal relationships of the different factors on a certain abstraction level [12]. Furthermore, critical realism has the potential to support eclecticism and integration in practice. It enables researchers to defend their work against the dismissal of qualitative methods by proponents of “science-based” research, since the latter assumes a positivist understanding of causation [13]. Critical realism has also been used in causal process tracing, which has emerged as an important method of causal inference in qualitative social science research, most notably in case study research designs [14][15]. In summary, critical realism provides a qualitative theory of causality that allows for the investigation of causal queries through both qualitative and quantitative research methods. It also supports eclecticism and integration in practice by enabling researchers to defend their work against the dismissal of qualitative methods and by being used in causal process tracing.

### Critical realism and constructivism in strategy research: toward a synthesis



[View full text](https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.200)Add to dashboard

**Abstract We agree with Kwan and Tsang (2001) that critical realism represents an important point of epistemological departure from mainstream realism, and that it has the potential to inform strategy research.** To that end, Kwan and Tsang's argument for a critical realist perspective is valid. There however exist substantial nontrivial differences between constructivism and critical realism. While critical realism contests some of the default assumptions of empiricism and realism which treat social systems as closed systems, it is still predicated upon an inherent order of things that is graspable by research. Constructivism instead focuses on the manner in which researchers constitute theories in the act of describing them. This important distinction makes constructivism far more of a departure from empiricism than critical realism, and therefore it has a different set of implications for strategy research.

### A philosophy of practice for systemic psychotherapy: the case for critical realism


[View full text](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-6427.12027)Add to dashboard

An argument is made for Bhaskar's critical realism as a more coherent, accountable and enabling philosophy of practice for systemic psychotherapy than the kinds of strong constructionism and pragmatism that are currently powerful in our field. Constructionism is positioned, not as an opponent to realism in the usual way, but -in a moderate version -as a necessary partner to give realism its critical edge. **The dimensions of critical realism are sketched and its potential for the coherent support of practice is illustrated with an analysis of a moment of therapeutic change.Practitioner points • Critical realism supports the understanding of multiply interacting causal tendencies, from genetics to discourse, providing a new platform for eclecticism and integration and a renewed, though cautious, relationship with science.** • The growing split between structuralism and poststructuralism is closed by critical realism, giving the potential for systemic family therapy to become a unified field. • The covert use of realism by clinicians is made accountable by critical realism.

### Critical Realism, Dialectics, and Qualitative Research Methods

**Abstract Critical realism has been an important advance in social science methodology because it develops a qualitative theory of causality which avoids some of the pitfalls of empiricist theories of causality.** But while there has been ample work exploring the relationship between critical realism and qualitative research methods there has been noticeably less work exploring the relationship between dialectical critical realism and qualitative research methods. This seems strange especially since the founder of the philosophy of critical realism, Roy Bhaskar, employs and develops a range of dialectical concepts in his later work in order to extend the main tenets of critical realism. The aim of this paper is to draw on Bhaskar's later work, as well as Marxism, to reorient a critical realist methodology towards a dialectical approach for qualitative research. In particular, the paper demonstrates how dialectical critical realism can begin to provide answers to three common criticisms made against original critical realist methodology: that the qualitative theory of causal powers and structures developed by critical realists is problematic; that critical realist methodology contains values which prove damaging to empirical research; and that critical realists often have difficulties in researching everyday qualitative dilemmas that people face in their daily lives.

### Critical realism in nursing: an emerging approach



[View full text](https://doi.org/10.1111/nup.12107)Add to dashboard

**Critical realism, a philosophical framework originally developed by Roy Bhaskar in the 1970s, represents a relatively new approach to research generally and to nursing research in particular.** This article explores the ontological and epistemological tenets of critical realism and examines the application of critical realist principles to nursing research and practice through a review of the literature. It is evident that few published nursing research studies have, as of yet, utilized critical realism as their paradigm of choice. Both the strengths and limitations of the presentation and use of critical realism in these studies are discussed in this article. Given the varying degrees of success of the authors in explicating critical realism as a philosophical framework, the value of critical realism to the research study, and the ways in which usage of the critical realist framework influenced development of the study and interpretation of findings, it is evident that the quality of future publications espousing the use of critical realism must continue to be strengthened significantly.

**Critical realism is a philosophy of science which has been developed as an alternative to positivism and interpretivism.** It has been argued that critical realism should be applied to research concerned with information and communication technologies (ICTs). In particular, it has been argued that critical realism can increase understanding of causal mechanisms and contexts that are needed in order to achieve outcomes from actions. However, there is a lack of examples of how critical realism might be applied in practice. The aim of the research was to investigate the potential for practical application of critical realism to research concerned with ICTs. Four interrelated examples are presented from practical application of critical realism during ICT research. These are examples of causal mechanism, technological context, social context and business context. Findings suggest that practical application of critical realism to ICT research in AECO may be possible without any particular training or extensive prior knowledge.

###[Critical Realism for Ethnography](https://scite.ai/reports/critical-realism-for-ethnography-2lrVe5E)

While specific applications of critical realism to ethnography are few, theoretical developments are promising and await more widespread development. This is especially the case for progressive and critical forms of ethnography that strive to be, in critical realist terms, an “emancipatory science.” However, the history of ethnography reveals that both the field and its emancipatory potential are limited by methodological tendencies toward “naïve realism” and “relativism.” This is the antimony of ethnography. The conceptual and methodological origins of ethnography are grounded in the historical tensions between anti-naturalist Kantian idealism and hyper-naturalist Humean realism. The resolution of these tensions can be found in the conceptual resources of critical realism. **Working from, and building upon, the work of British philosopher Roy Bhaskar, critical realism is a movement in the philosophy of science that transcends the limits of Kantian idealism and Humean realism via an emancipatory anti-positivist naturalism.** Critical realism emerged as part of the post-positivist movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. From its Marxian origins, critical realism insists that all science, including the social sciences, must be emancipatory. At its essence, this requires taking ontology seriously. The call of critical realism to ethnographers, like all social scientists, is that while they must hold to epistemological caution this does not warrant ontological shyness. Furthermore, critical realism’s return to ontology implies that ethnographers must be ethically serious. Ethnography, if it is to hold to its progressive inclinations, must be about something. Critical realism for ethnography pushes the field to see itself as more than a sociological practice. Rather, it is to be understood as a social practice for something: the universalizing of human freedom.

Abstracts Tobin Nelhaus, Signs, Social Ontology, and Critical Realism, pp. **1-24.Even though sign-systems are a crucial part of society, critical realism, as developed by Roy Bhaskar, does not yet have an adequate theory of signs and semiosis.** The few suggestions that Bhaskar offers can be advanced through the semiotics of C.S. Peirce. In doing so, however, it becomes necessary to reconsider Bhaskar's ontological domains of the real, the actual, and the subjective, and expand the last domain into one of semiosis. This new understanding of ontological domains, incorporating Peireian semiotics, provides the basis for rethinking the ontology of society: the customary dyad structures/agents becomes the triad structures/agents/discourses, each of which possesses material, sociological, and meaningful aspects.

**The influence of Bhaskar's critical realism has become increasingly evident in the debate on the nature of educational research.** This philosophy, dedicated to the overthrow of positivist doctrines, in particular those of empiricism, nominalism, and causation as constant conjunction, is the foundation of contemporary proposals for new perspectives and possibilities in educational research. There are, however, aspects of critical realism, as it is presented, that may repay further reflection. This article suggests that the rejection of statistical modelling by critical realism is not supported by scientific realism. The argument is illustrated by substantive analyses of the relationship between poverty and educational attainment (reading) using the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) 2000 UK data set. It is concluded that an approach to the construction of explanatory narratives based on scientific realism is more likely to effect a principled integration of the theory and practice of qualitative and quantitative research.

**Critical realism is an established post-positivist philosophy applied by researchers in a number of fields and yet it is little used in educational leadership and management (ELM) research.** This article responds to calls from the field for a more critical approach to educational leadership and management research by offering critical realism as a way to address these concerns and it explores why critical realism has not featured more in the field, particularly as it could provide that more critical approach. The use of critical realism as analytical approach as well as a content enables the linkage of the calls from ELM to critical realist features and then to some constraints upon its use in the field. Theory around the application of critical realism is advanced providing insights for researchers in its use, though no claim is made that critical realism is the only way to do so.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of qualitative research in causality, with particular emphasis on process causality. In one paper, it is not possible to discuss all the issues of causality, but the aim is to provide useful ways of thinking about causality and qualitative research. Specifically, a brief overview of the regularity theory of causation is provided, qualitative research characteristics and ontological and epistemological views that serve as a potential conceptual frame to resolve some tensions between quantitative and qualitative work are discussed and causal processes are explored. This paper offers a definition and a model of process causality and then presents findings from an exploratory study that advanced the discussion beyond the conceptual frame. Design/methodology/approach This paper first conceptually frames process causality within qualitative research and then discusses results from an exploratory study that involved reviewing literature and interviewing expert researchers. The exploratory study conducted involved analyzing multiple years of literature in two top human resource development (HRD) journals and also exploratory expert interviews. The study was guided by the research question: How might qualitative research inform causal inferences in HRD? This study used a basic qualitative approach that sought insight through inductive analysis within the focus of this study. Findings The exploratory study found that triangulation, context, thick description and process research questions are important elements of qualitative studies that can improve research that involves causal relationships. Specifically, qualitative studies provide both depth of data collection and descriptive write-up that provide clues to cause-and-effect relationships that support or refute theory. Research limitations/implications A major conclusion of this study is that qualitative research plays a critical role in causal inference, albeit an understated one, when one takes an enlarged philosophical view of causality. **Equating causality solely with variance theory associated with quantitative research leaves causal processes locked in a metaphoric black box between cause and effect, whereas qualitative research opens up the processes and mechanisms contained within the box.** Originality/value This paper reframed the discussion about causality to include both the logic of quantitative studies and qualitative studies to demonstrate a more holistic view of causality and to demonstrate the value of qualitative research for causal inference. Process causality in qualitative research is added to the mix of techniques and theories found in the larger discussion of causality in HRD.

The concept of causation has long been controversial in qualitative research, and many qualitative researchers have rejected causal explanation as incompatible with an interpretivist or constructivist approach. This rejection conflates causation with the positivist theory of causation, and ignores an alternative understanding of causation, variously known as a “generative,” “process,” or “realist” approach, which is influential in philosophy and is becoming widespread in the social sciences and history. This alternative approach to causation is compatible with the practice and “theory-in-use” of many qualitative researchers and enables qualitative researchers to credibly make and support causal claims. **It also enables them to defend their work against the dismissal of qualitative methods by proponents of “science-based” research, since the latter assumes a positivist understanding of causation.** Adequate causal explanations in the social sciences depend on the in-depth understanding of meanings, contexts, and processes that qualitative research can provide.

**Causal process tracing (CPT) has emerged as an important method of causal inference in qualitative social science research, most notably in case study research designs.** There is now a considerable literature on the aims, philosophical groundings, and methods of process tracing. This paper reviews the CPT literature to assess what new directions it may suggest for policy studies. The first part of the paper sets out the methodological advantages CPT offers in building and testing theories of policy change, most notably in supporting a theoretical pluralism to address the problem of complexity in policy studies. Building on recent scholarship across the social sciences, the second part examines step by step the recently minted “best practice” for undertaking CPT in policy studies. This part includes discussion of the possible pitfalls of CPT as a method; common errors involved in its use are set out and minimization strategies offered. In particular, while acknowledging the usefulness of Bayesian tests for causality as heuristic devices, we emphasize the limitations of applying such tests in practice. Possible correctives are suggested. The final part of the paper speculates more generally on the potential of CPT to improve our investigation of patterns of policy change over time.

This chapter examines how the qualitative and quantitative research traditions empirically assess theories about mechanisms when making causal inferences. In the qualitative paradigm, researchers carry out this assessment by attempting to observe causal mechanisms through process tracing and through the analysis of causal-process observations. **In the qualitative paradigm, the within-case analysis of specific cases is combined with the effort to observe mechanisms.** By contrast, statistical methods are not designed to observe mechanisms within particular cases. The chapter considers the importance of mechanisms in causal inference as well as the use of process tracing in multimethod vs. qualitative research. It shows that multimethod research, which integrates regression and case study analysis, is increasingly regarded as a best practice.
