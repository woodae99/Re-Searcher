# Emergentism
Emergence will be a core theme throughout the PhD. It might be seen as an upgrade to causality which tends to be more linear whereas emergence is at minimum systemic and probably not even reducible to that.

Why would it be important to understand what emergency is and what role it plays?

- One of the things it might give us is some clues about how to go about #analysis and understanding of the situation and dynamics, contributors etc to ourselves, the problems that we face, and the plans that we have for improving them. #assessment  
- We could apply some sort of razor here as well. For example if simple 
	- **linear causality** is sufficient to explain a particular situation then it's pointless looking at systemic origins. 
	- If the problem is best understood or solved by viewing **systemic origins** then that is sufficient. 
	- If neither are sufficient then perhaps some sort of unexplained **emergence** is a viable proposition to aid understanding. #ordinal #level_of_analysis 
- The components of any of these systems can be broken down with relationships identified between all of the competing and contributing components leading to an understanding of the parts that are at play and possible reasons for things being the way that they are, possible ways to handle developing future strategies to change them and perhaps even metrics comma collaboration and other things that we might want to use , collaboration and other things that we might want to use to collectively move towards a more desirable situation. #relationships 

There are a great many other topics associated with emergentism. In the hypothesis note which is linked to this document there is a Wikipedia article with several associated fields that are worth looking at. This is a #todo
