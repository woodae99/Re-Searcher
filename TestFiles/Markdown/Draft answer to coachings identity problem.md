**Notes on how to define coaching - what it is, what are it's characteristic processes, purpose and so on**

Cut from how to compile on contact:
	1) Coaching is finding the client where they are, in their own context (assessment), then
	2) Coaching is locating the client and context within frameworks, teaching them the framework or agreeing on ones to use, then
	3) Coaching is implementing that in life - grounding, embedding, growing etc. through reflective practice
	4) Coaching is the employment and awareness of unfolding - above these are heavily analytical, this is flow - a completely different sensibility
	5) Coaching is the management or steering of those things through emphasis - skilful means, curiosity, creativity

Coaching is a reflective process, but it's reciprocally reflective, dialogical. This means that it is not a personal reflective inquiry, though it might be limited to that in some cases, it is always the case that there are at least two sets of reflective surfaces in a coaching relationship - at a minimum, those are the set of surfaces present within the client and those present within the coach. Others might come from contexts such as history, culture, organisational factors, other people and so on.
Coaching isn't about asking questions, it is about an active dialogic that may contain, or even be heavily skewed towards the question as a format, but it is by no means to be restricted to this mode of inquiry.

So coaching is living reflexivity in dialogue, or dialogical reflexivity. This is what coaching is, for the benefit, however it's envisioned, of the client. It's reflective for both (all) parties, so both the coach and the client are in a reflective space and that reflection is two people taking an appropriate (as jointly envisioned e.g. by the intake process, issue description etc.) view of the issue, themselves and the world and relating to each other, and an anticipated (provisional) idea of how it will be approached, so that there are just that many more sources and surfaces for the contemplation, reflection and proposed action, experiment, learning, etc. 

The unity of coaching is formed in com-mune-ity, both attend personally and construct a communal third environment within which they both (all) reside for the purposes of enacting coaching. So it's the two need to become unified in purpose in the conceptual bubble of coaching. For the two to become one, you have to have rapport, commonality in purpose, agreement on myth, ritual and enactment as well as explicit ways of knowledge gathering, learning and so on. 

And so for coaching to work at all you have to allow for it to be safe and welcoming, etc. for both (all) people to come in. And then the other factors such as the myth and ritual, the belief in it and a commitment to the path. Those are things in the two becoming one and I don't know how the Prochaska and Norcross transtheoretical model would work into that but. It seems quite a nice way to do the process side of coaching.

Below is a quick note that I recorded with some thoughts about how coaching might be defined and an idea of what it might actually be.

Some thoughts on what coaching is and possible definitions for it

It seems to me that the fundamental, ever present condition necessary for coaching to exist is the need for change. Sometimes this change might be minor, for example interpersonal supportive measures which may be temporary and comparatively insubstantial which a person might need simply to endure a stressful period. The change here is from one of perhaps feeling more lonely to a feeling of community and support. Change may be way more complicated of course, an individual may need to shift altitude, develop new skills, acquire dramatic new adaptive behaviours, deal with intense or deeply uncertain situations that involve critical decisions, or many more factors besides these. In this case the change profile is dramatically more complex, multidimensional, and requires much more thorough analysis of the situation as it stands, the congruence of the envisioned outcome and its compatibility with the predicted future, broken down in the same way through analysis with the gaps between the as is and the to be examined according to a comprehensive set of dimensions, each of which attracting its own distinctive types of interventions, each having its own requirements, timescales, resources and so on. The “process of coaching” is then the execution of those interventions along each of the dimensions as previously set out. The requirements of each of those executions is determined by the needs represented by the Delta between the as is and to be states along that particular dimension. This is where coaching is multidisciplinary nexus style character is invoked. Some sort of profile that dips into psychology, counselling, consulting, reflective practice and any number of other skills or capacities will be drawn on in the community of the coaching engagement. The effectiveness of the coach is only one element in a massive moving and systemic interpersonal, personal, organisational and cultural, developmental, skill building enterprise. While a coach might be better able to deal with this broad range of things if they are able to integrate them all, they need not do so, specialisations are perfectly acceptable as long as things that full without the specialisations are acknowledged and known by the coach, from which point they can refer to others to support the client through the completion of their process.
In any event it is highly unlikely that a single coach would be able to cover the spectrum that might be needed by complex engagements. The mitigating factor here is that coaches, clients and organisations are all fundamentally interlinked with one another and so interventions and one given area are likely to have repercussions throughout the entire connected web of systems, interpersonal connections, behavioural manifestations and so on. My contention remains though that an integrated and complete set of interventions should be attracted to any complex change requirement in order to a) cover the bases as comprehensively as possible B) give the change intervention as many threads of traction as possible C) supply the client with several strategies to execute simultaneously with the idea that pulling on several threads attached to the same issue will improve the chances of that change process unfolding more completely, quickly and hopefully more easily resulting in the better attainment of preferred outcomes.
Conversely, coaches should be well aware of their limitations, except themselves as intermediate and incomplete actors in a very complex world, and build a culture of referral and support to other coaches with diverse capabilities, perspectives, altitudes et cetera for the sake of helping the client achieve their desired outcomes.

29/08/20 - above, I didn't define coaching
Try this: 
If coaching can’t be defined apart from its context, then what are the things that are given context that are the things that constitute coaching? Are they processes?
I had a shot at defining coaching elsewhere in my Zettlr notes (above), but here follows another one. Coaching is a nonclinical, collaborative, critical process for personal, behavioural and interpersonal , systemic change.
Nonclinical – defined by the context of the collective-does the coach have the necessary clinical skills, and does the client desire clinical intervention.
Collaborative - perhaps it can be said that coaching is inter-holonic, in that the same processes can occur intra-personally i.e. I coach myself. By definition a dialogic of some form exists between 2 or more people.
Critical - a careful and critical assessment of what is, that is - a consideration of the present ontology with a view to emancipation as expressed in an improved ontology.
Personal/behavioural - for individual holons, most commonly people, the interior and exterior of the individual is the subject of coaching 
Cultural/Systemic - every individual is always already in relationship and therefore inside culture (but not only inside culture) and every culture expresses itself in systemic forms e.g. modes of production, politics, economics etc. Coaching individual holons puts in the foreground personal change and has as its background culture and system, cultural coaching puts culture and system in the foreground and has in the background the personal behavioural. For each approach the other is present but necessarily secondary.

Another attempt - coaching is an assisted, conscious engagement with evolutionary processes. Particularly in the nooshpere, but also in the theoshere and the biosphere.
