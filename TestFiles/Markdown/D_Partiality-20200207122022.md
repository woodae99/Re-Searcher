# Partiality
Partiality is characteristic of all perspectives and is necessary for all things. I can't wear this outfit today without 
The thing that is the enemy (edit - not so much enemy, but the thing that is encountered and pushed back and this pushing back is the thing that is called "better", the furthest one can see along that dimension is "best" and at the end of it, it points to "truth". It's a dimension, so there are degrees of it. I guess also it could be "normal" and it could be pathological, also, I expect as a consequence of degree.
Partiality can refer to two types of growth - horizontal a la [Suszanne Cook-Greuter] and vertical, a la all developmentalists. 
Each case of partiality is solved in different ways, takes different amounts of time and yeilds different results.
Partiality is an #axiom - all people are always partial to some degree until their ultimate enlightenment, but this is more commonly experienced in daily life as not being able to detect the world through physical senses - e.g. physical blindspots, inattentional blindness etc. Through the interior senses such as cognitive biases - and I had that thing with a list of 50 biases and authors, infographic type thing ![50-cognitive-biases.png](C:/Users/colin/OneDrive/Documents/aStudies/PhD/Zettlr/resources/50-cognitive-biases.png)

Partiality is a result of imperfect perception and understanding. Whatever is perceived is not the thing in totality that is the object of perception, and the perception of the thing is not complete by the perceiver. There are structural issues, beliefs and other filters and all kids of systemic and other pollutants or blockages, then, on top of all of this shit is the fact that, even if we have a good perception of the thing and it's well understood that there is the possibility that there is simply an error in the math.
