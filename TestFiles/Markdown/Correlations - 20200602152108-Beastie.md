###### Issues with technical eclecticism, the academic practitioner divide, correlations and development and emergence
Technicality, an example of which might be technical eclecticism in psychotherapy and coaching, is a low order scale or low order viewpoint, it lacks vision, it can't see where it's going but it does things very well it's probably more reactive and is not strategic. If you add strategy to technicality you add theory, or you imply theory because no strategy can be formulated without an associated theory of the world. Of course theories are more static than the worlders and so with a moving world in front of you theories are more it most usefully considered as guiding forces as opposed to absolute sources of reference. It is the job of theory to reflect and comply with reality as it is disclosed not the other way around. I'm imagining a hierarchy in which skills or technicality of the lowest order of things even the most primitive tool using animals have skill but none of them have any form of vision.

In this way technical eclecticism, while it might be pragmatically useful within short time horizons and closed contexts, it has limited stuff to say about the world in which its skills are being deployed, the very world that coaching clients are required to navigate daily. A philosophy, a theory of the world within which coaching or therapy or any other thing can be carried out is therefore an essential thing to contain eclecticism, to give it context, directionality, probably even morality and vision.

This might be the basis for some sort of commentary on the academic/practitioner divide, where the academic is more inclined to see the world in context of his philosophy and the practitioner is more inclined to see it more in context of his skills. Skills and theory are not necessarily native bedfellows, but they cannot be unrelated if either of them are to remain relevant. To paraphrase Einstein, skills without theory are blind and theory without skills is paralysed. Skills are more likely to be centred around the exterior quadrants, with their concomitant knowledge and methodologies, while theories and philosophies are more likely to be centred around the interior quadrants with their concomitant epistemologies and methodologies. Each of them is valid terrain for science and as above, both are essential in an integrated view of the world.


All of this means that, in the pursuit of growth, and the doing of science the collective nature of our endeavours cannot be understated. Those more predisposed to theoretical interpretations of the world should realise that they are bound to wheelchairs, even if they have farsighted vision, and those with strong legs to run are blinded even if they are fast. The cooperation of both then, it seems can only result in good things for both. Direction in one direction from theory to practice, and feedback in the other direction of what is happening in the world so that the theoretical map becomes  better adapted to future endeavours. 

We are probably not looking at a polarity here because these two things are correlates of one another, they are both real things in the world, but do they really consist of a spectrum?
