Free will is the ability to choose (relatively*) freely, including not to choose at all. Free will as it appears to be within the formal context can be usefully viewed as the ability of a meta thought form to be able to objectively contain, evaluate and select among possible alternatives in a given context. The constraining variables in the formal case is the level of complexity that the form has to contain these perspectives and the attendant means of comparison, state of the forms and the visibility to, or knowledge of possible alternatives. 
I can't see (signified) at 2nd pp a referent at 4th pp. If I do see it, I see it not in its 4th pp fullness, but in terms of the 2nd pp reductions that I must make in order to see it at all. Therefore, whatever is being signified belongs to an entirely different ontological universe.  

So, in form it is 0-->0 or 0-->+ or - something, but that is always going to be relative and therefore have dependencies like context or viewpoint etc.
 
Free will is not absolutely free, it is always bounded. Free will is relative, and non-deterministic.
So where SH talks about brain state a being the only thing needed to predict brain state b, and even if such a thing was knowable (the state) you would also have to know that it was the only thing that was needed to know what brain state b is. Which can't be true for several reasons, firstly because there are effects that will have an impact on b without bein knowable in a, such as environmental or other factors not knowable in advance. Secondly that if there is anyone at all home, then there is going to be a (partial) steering function that tends the brain state b towards something. That is what's free in free will.
We know that most brain activity is useless, repetitive and automatic, there's no one thinking the thoughts, they are just arising based on all the stuff going on, conditions, history, culture and all the rest of the things. But the fact that for most people most of the time there is no one at the helm, and we're on autopilot, doesn't mean that there isn't a steering function available that we can use, within limits, if we choose to.

Tending towards something is an attempt to increase the likelihood of it happening, but doesn't mean that it will.

Evolution, one of the processes of telesis, is "blind" from the human, self-reflexive standpoint in all occasions before there is a self-reflexive capable capacity. Till then evolution is mostly automatic, not because its unconscious, but because it's un-self-reflexively conscious. After that, it becomes aware of its own movement and how it has always been involved in this process, but the metaperspective was not available to inform that consciousness of the fact yet.
