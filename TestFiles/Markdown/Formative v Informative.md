These make a feedback loop that is moderated by the abductive arc, is that normative? Maybe normative means cultural...?
Information becomes formation, formal knowledge and is tested as if it was true, or true enough to test. Each test results in more information which is what forms knowledge and it's evolution at all scales.
# Formative Arc
The formative arc is active, expressive, creative, exploratory and while it's law-based, or based on an assumption of law, it's not exhaustively law-bounded - it might be wrong, incomplete, or redundant, then the data that arise from it's enaction will contain clues about the mismatch. [Kolb](Kolbs%20Learning%20Styles%20and%20Experiential%20Learning%20Cycle%20%20Simply%20Psychology.md) fit's beautifully here. Think about the OME triplet here. We are talking about knowledge, I guess at all levels of existence, even pure physical sensory based adaptation would probably follow some sort of similar path in the sense of adapting and probably evolving given data arriving from the external world or from the “other”. Maybe this can plug into the stages of dialectic. You might say something based on preexisting knowledge which would give you the first phases: formal knowledge goes North, action goes East, reflection goes South, 

Is Kolb a process model, or is he mixing a substance model?

It proceeds in a deductive manner, which is expressed from a view (assumed or explicit theory) of the world and context and goes forth with an expectation of some creative efficacy. It has intent and form. It may not give back a complete confirmation of what was intended and that differential can be used to look at where the gaps are. They could be anywhere, so we need a way to step back to see if we can trace the mismatch to a place in the thread. it might not be that the mismatch indicates a philosophical deficiency, it might be something at the technology level, or some factor of practical application that needs to be improved in order to get better results from the given action. However this might not be the case and persistent data outside of expected norms would suggest that the problem is embedded earlier on in the chain. For example if you can't count for the interior of experience of an individual by reducing that individual's experience to a product of synaptic firing, then the odds are that you don't have a theoretical problem, you've got a philosophical one.

Of course, every action assumes a well represented historical version of the world, and at the time of action the world might be different in some way, in which case the deductive chain delivered what it should have, but needs to be updated to better reflect and incorporate the newly detected reality. in addition, every action updates the historical world from the previous concrete moment to this one, and so there is a necessary feedback loop required to test the requisite diversity capable of being supported by the chain such that it can accommodate the experienced variety of outcome. If not then further investigation further down the chain is required

Emergence is backwards compatible with law at some LoA where there is support, and is forward expressive of it
It creates reality anew from the existing laws of form at some LoA

## Contrast
Nondual would see these as not other than each other and not other than itself

# Informative Arc

The informative arc allows data to flow back from the new present to do two things. 
1) confirm or 
2) adjust the veracity of the action and it's antecedents and 

If there is a good correspondence of action with environment, then a confirmation happens and the action becomes more deeply entrenched.
If not then.
These processes are not locked out of their history - they can find supporting law at whatever level they need. For example a cultural system, built over time on the combined expression of the individuals that comprise it within the contextual environment concomitant with it. That system may endure for some time, adapting as it can to changes from within and without, however, there may come a time when the system can't maintain itself for any of a number of reasons, e.g. the interior assumptions were not durable enough to contain the variety of its potential or expression, or it was overwhelmed or undercut by some contextual factor, etc. These lead to the destabilisation of the system, it loses equilibrium and regresses. The limits of the form of law as seen a the LoA of the culture before its collapse are breached and their repetition is no longer found to enable persistence. Persistence is one of the UNC and so the whole thing is given over to an emphasis on Entropy, deconstruction will occur rapidly until a base in a former version of the law is found, say its experiment in equality overreaches its ability to support that expression, it may collapse to a version of being that existed before, or if that is not available to something comparatively more primitive - perhaps all the way down to basic survival of close-knit bands from much earlier times in history. 

Recall that all later stages of something contain within them the prior stages, and those habits of being, those forms and their laws remain intact within them, even if they are wrapped up in some more complex modes of expression. For example, the modes of individual survival are always present in all later expressions, even if the appearance of them specific to their LoA is subsumed or ignored, it will be there to be called upon if there is a regression that has no support at higher modes, or configurations of law.
