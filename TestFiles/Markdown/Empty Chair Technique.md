Looking as Zone 1, looking at Zone 2 of the same holon. That's the focus, but doesn't mean the other [zones](Zones.md) aren't present or active. The therapist is looking as Zone 1 at another holon's Zone 1 looking at it's own Zone 2. If the context is community of other as opposed to community of self, then the therapist might also encourage and support the Zone 1 looking as exercise to other zones, too.
