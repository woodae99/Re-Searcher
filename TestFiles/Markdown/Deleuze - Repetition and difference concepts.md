| Virtual and Actual<br><br>Concepts in Deleuze's Repetition and Difference that explore the distinction between the virtual (potentialities) and the actual (realized states of affairs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | "But that is not the case because actualization and realization are two very different processes.", "The first will be an analysis of Deleuze's reading of virtuality and actualization as it is described in Bergsonism."<br><br>T.

| Difference in Itself<br><br>Deleuze argues that difference is not simply a contrast between two things but is an ontological force that constitutes reality. Difference is not derivative of identity or sameness but is primary and fundamental.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Language model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| The Plane of Immanence<br><br>This is a metaphysical concept that refers to the single, underlying field of reality on which all things exist. It is characterized by immanence, meaning that nothing transcends it or stands outside of it.These concepts are deeply interconnected and form the basis of Deleuze's philosophical project in "Difference and Repetition," which aims to overturn traditional metaphysics and establish a new, affirmative philosophy based on difference and becoming. | Language model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
