# The Decentred self
The decent itself can step aside from egocentrism and take the role of other. Refer to Piaget in SES location 4843 where Kane is talking about the move from concrete operational which sets aside the ego but merely replaces it with an ethnocentric orientation.
De-centring is the process of continuously standing aside from the ego until the separate ego ceases to exist and only the one remains.
Refer also to location 4853 in SES. Where the divine is seen as one's very self, common in and to all peoples (in fact all Sentient beings), a self that is the great omega point of this entire series of decreasing egocentrism, of decentring from the small self in order to find the big self-self common in to all beings and thus escaping the egocentrism (and ethnocentrism) of each.
