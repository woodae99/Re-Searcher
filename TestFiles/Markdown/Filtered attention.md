The human brain is constantly bombarded with an enormous amount of sensory information from the environment, yet our conscious experience is remarkably selective and focused. The process by which the brain filters out most of this incoming information and attends to only the most relevant or important stimuli is a topic of extensive research in cognitive neuroscience and psychology. Here is a survey of some of the key research and theories on this topic:

1. Selective Attention and Attentional Filters:
   - Broadbent's Filter Model (1958): One of the earliest theories, which proposed that attention acts as a filter that selects certain information early in the processing stream while filtering out other irrelevant information.
   - Treisman's Attenuation Model (1964): This model suggests that unattended information is attenuated or weakened but not completely filtered out, allowing for some processing of unattended stimuli.
   - Lavie's Load Theory of Attention (1995): This theory proposes that the degree of filtering depends on the perceptual load or cognitive demands of the attended task. When the load is high, irrelevant information is effectively filtered out, but when the load is low, more irrelevant information can be processed.

2. Neural Mechanisms of Attentional Selection:
   - Studies using neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, EEG, MEG) have identified brain regions and networks involved in attentional selection, such as the frontal eye fields, superior parietal cortex, and the dorsal attention network.
   - Biased Competition Model (Desimone and Duncan, 1995): This model suggests that attention biases the competition for neural representation in favor of the attended stimuli, enhancing the processing of relevant information while suppressing irrelevant information.
   - Predictive Coding and Bayesian Brain Theories: These theories propose that the brain actively generates predictions about the incoming sensory input and filters out information that does not match these predictions, thereby optimizing the processing of relevant information.

3. Perceptual and Cognitive Factors in Attentional Selection:
   - Saliency and Bottom-up Factors: Attention can be captured by salient or highly contrasting stimuli in a bottom-up, stimulus-driven manner (e.g., a flashing light or a loud sound).
   - Top-down Factors: Attention can also be guided by top-down factors, such as goals, expectations, and prior knowledge, which influence the selection of relevant information.
   - Emotional Significance: Stimuli with emotional or motivational significance tend to capture attention more readily than neutral stimuli, involving brain regions like the amygdala and the ventral attention network.

4. Individual Differences and Clinical Implications:
   - Research has explored individual differences in attentional abilities, such as the capacity for sustained attention or the ability to filter out distractions, and their relationship with factors like working memory capacity, intelligence, and personality traits.
   - Attentional deficits and difficulties in filtering out irrelevant information are observed in various clinical conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders.

This survey covers some of the key theories, neural mechanisms, and factors involved in how the human brain filters out most of the incoming sensory information and selectively attends to relevant stimuli. It is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to understand the complex interplay between bottom-up and top-down factors, the neural circuits involved, and the implications for cognitive functioning and mental health.
