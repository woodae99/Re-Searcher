# Ego
See aliases and make a #todo disambiguation section - definitions for ego and self and self-system and soul and so on

For now, the ego will be the psychological self, the one that thinks thoughts and adepts to the mental world, the one that interprets and creates the world in its own image, the one that mistakenly believes it is the true self. This psychological self is the central repository for the set of patterns that are collectively and characteristically called the “personality”.
