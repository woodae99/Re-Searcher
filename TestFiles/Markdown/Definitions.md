# 2 Metalanguage
[A metalanguage is a language used to talk about or describe another language, often referred to as the object language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage). [It’s a set of terms and concepts that are used for analysis, discussion, or instruction about the language itself](https://englishlive.ef.com/en/blog/language-lab/metalanguage-will-help-english/)[2](https://englishlive.ef.com/en/blog/language-lab/metalanguage-will-help-english/)[3](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-metalanguage-1691382). For example, in English, terms like “noun,” “verb,” and “adjective” are part of the metalanguage because they describe elements of the language. [Metalanguage is crucial in fields such as linguistics, logic, and programming, where it helps to define grammar, structure, and semantics of the object language](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8316/metalanguage)[4](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8316/metalanguage). [It’s also important in education, as understanding metalanguage can improve one’s ability to learn and teach a language](https://englishlive.ef.com/en/blog/language-lab/metalanguage-will-help-english/)[2](https://englishlive.ef.com/en/blog/language-lab/metalanguage-will-help-english/).


# 3 Communicata
The term **“Communicata”** could serve as a comprehensive catch-all term for all forms of communication across various aspects of reality. Let’s explore its meaning:

1. **Definition**:
    
    - **Communicata** (noun): A conceptual umbrella encompassing all modes, instances, and collections of communication. It transcends boundaries, connecting everything from subatomic interactions to social discourse.
    - **Etymology**: Derived from Latin roots, combining **“communicare”** (to share, make common) and **“data”** (information).
2. **Scope**:
    
    - **Interactions**: Communicata includes exchanges between particles, forces, organisms, and societies.
    - **Mediums**: It spans verbal, non-verbal, written, symbolic, and sensory channels.
    - **Content**: From fundamental physical laws to cultural norms, all information exchange falls under Communicata.
3. **Examples**:
    
    - **Quantum Entanglement**: Communicata manifests in entangled particles instantaneously influencing each other’s states.
    - **Chemical Signaling**: Foxes communicate through scent markers, conveying territory boundaries and reproductive readiness.
    - **Language and Norms**: Social discourse, legal codes, and shared beliefs are part of the vast Communicata network.
4. **Currency of Exchange**:
    
    - **Information**: Communicata thrives on the currency of information—transmitting knowledge, intentions, and meaning.

In summary, **Communicata** bridges the microcosmic and macrocosmic, weaving a universal tapestry of communication. Feel free to embrace this term as a versatile descriptor for the intricate web of information exchange!
# 4 Proclivity

NOUN

**proclivity** (noun) · **proclivities** (plural noun)

1. a tendency to choose or do something regularly; an inclination or predisposition towards a particular thing
ORIGIN

late 16th century: from Latin proclivitas, from proclivis ‘inclined’, from pro- ‘forward, down’ + clivus ‘slope’.

[Symfrazomena](Symfrazomena.md) , Greek word for Context - S, So, OME+S
That gives me:
I - Individual
C - Collective
S - Context, which is everything that is relevant to the OME at a given LoA. Environment, culture, goals, history, state... everything ^b490bb

- Ritual - add def
- Community - add def 
- Living tradition - what comes about when M,R,C are all in place and allowed to emerge in the moment
# 6 [[Anagoge]]
- a method of spiritual or mystical interpretation of philosophical or literary texts, often used in allegorical readings of scripture. It involves interpreting text in a way that reveals a higher spiritual or symbolic meaning beyond the literal or historical context. The term originated from Greek, meaning "uplifting" or "ascent". Connect to [Agape](Eros%20&%20Agape.md#^f60aed) [Myth and Ritual](Myth%20and%20Ritual.md) 
# 7 Monologic
- from Greek "mono", meaning one and "logos" meaning word or reason. Monologic, monological, monology are all concerned with monologue resulting in one view, one word, one way, one truth etc.
# 8 Register
- to realise. The appearance of something in awareness. The inventory of items thus available to consciousness.
# 9 Emancipation
- The ultimate goal of coaching. Emancipation is not to be free from particulars, but to be free from all particulars and to re-orient towards them without being defined or qualified by them
- liberation or release. Release from delusions (false perception) and (the claimership of) earthly desires that leads to the attainment of freedom. It also means release from transmigration in the world of suffering. There are various stages of emancipation, but [emancipation](https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/E/59#:~:text=Release%20from%20delusions%20and%20earthly%20desires%20that%20leads,release%20from%20transmigration%20in%20the%20world%20of%20suffering.) at its ultimate stage is the same as nirvana.
# 10 Nexus
- noun, plural nex·us·es, nex·us (source - [Nexus Definition & Meaning | Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nexus))
	- a means of connection; tie; link.
	- a connected series or group.
	- the core or center, as of a matter or situation.
- **Communis** - is a Latin word that means “common, public, general, shared by all or many” . It is derived from the prefix “com-” meaning “together” and the word “munus” meaning “employment, office, service; burden, duty, obligation”
- **Complexity** - the degree to which something, a holon or a collective is differentiated and included. One tends towards greater complexity, where #complexity increases as systems are increasingly differentiated and enfolded.

# 11 Semiotics
## 11.1 Signifier
- as in Saussure's scheme of semiotics (primarily) - the aspect of the sign that points to a referent in the world (of experience) e.g. a particular horse, feeling or thought. In my most general usage, this refers to any form that stands for, or indicates, in whole or in part, something else. 
## 11.2 Signified
- That which the "signifier" is supposed to give rise to within first-person awareness. The "signified", is what is brought to mind, or is intended to bring to mind. In dialogue, this occurs through the intersubjective space by some means of communication - in this case, the recall into awareness of a particular horse, feeling or thought.
## 11.3 Referent
- the "thing in the world" (of experience) being referred to, or pointed out.
# 12 Awareness
- embodied conscious registration resulting in experience. Awareness refers to all modes of perception, not only the mental.
# 13 Experience
- most generally, is the hold-all for what is, and can be, registered in awareness or encountered in any modality whether gross, subtle, causal, imaginary etc. Experience has two aspects, one is temporal and therefore also historical and presupposes a subject and an object, the other is the immediate conscious contact of embodied awareness, is ahistorical and has no subject or object.
# 14 Consciousness
- That which is aware and is the source of experience. See Heidegger - "being", Plotinus "the one"
# 15 Form
- most generally, is anything with extension at any level, in any modality and that is subject to space and time. For example, an atom, a tree, a musical note, these words and my personal experience of them all have extension, are all bound to and exist within space and time and therefore have/are "form". All form is holonic
## 15.1 Formalism
- add definition #todo 
# 16 Process
- most generally, is the unfolding in time of form. Process implies two fundamental aspects of change - evolution and devolution with the presence of syntropy and entropy to keep the cycle going - and is the central organising principle proposed in this project
# 17 Holon
- an individual whole (from one level of analysis) that is simultaneously a part (from the next-higher-order level of analysis) indefinitely in both directions. The basic constituent of formal reality
# 18 Level, or Level of Analysis
- an ordinal perspective. For now, associated with holonic theory as above.
## 18.1 Ordinal
- prefixes "sub" and "super" ordinal - A contextually given level of analysis, designated by the numeral 0. Indicating the position being taken on a given referent. For sub and super ordinal, designations are 0-*n* where "-" designates "sub-ordinal", and 0+*n*, where "+" designates "super-ordinal" and in all cases, where *n* indicates the degree of sub or super ordinality.
## 18.2 Relative
- most generally, is the spatiotemporal co-relationships that exist within and between holons at any level.
----------------------------------------------
# 19 **Exapt**
1. (evolution) To exhibit [exaptation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exaptation "exaptation"); To [repurpose](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/repurpose "repurpose") a pre-existing adaptation. [[exapt]]

- **Adaptation** - The process of coming to "negotiated" equilibrium with self, other and system. This is translational, but also transformational
	- Assimilation - [Assimilation](Jean%20Piaget%20%20Cognitive%20Theory%20%20Simply%20Psychology.md#^2bd1e7) this is ordinal - connection to existing knowledge without altering existing schemas. 
	- Accommodation - [Accommodation](Jean%20Piaget%20%20Cognitive%20Theory%20%20Simply%20Psychology.md#^d9cc59) Horizontal (ordinal) and / or superordinal searching (via disequilibrium - see disorienting dilemma) resulting in a new equilibrium, or attrition leading to extinction of schemas - evolution in a word
	- Equilibration - [Equilibration](Jean%20Piaget%20%20Cognitive%20Theory%20%20Simply%20Psychology.md#^f9cdc0) new equilibrium of negotiated truce with the world.
# 20 **Transcendent**
Something that goes beyond a given ordinal, defines and organises it, within which all 0-n relate and also produces emergent features not reducible to the components 
## 20.1 **Transcend** (and include)
Any ordinal holon provides the leadership for the community of subholons that comprise it. The structure (vs chaos) of the system, the known, or knowable (vs the unknown or the unknowable). To transcend and reject is problematic because the logic of it is to assume that the leadership now in place is a naturally available a la carte menu item, not something that emerged out of something itself more primitive. Transcend and reject generates shadow in that the included sub holon remains included while its presence, effects and contributions are rejected resulting in an internal contradiction in the ordinal holon. It has the effect of cutting off the developmental rungs that preceded the present holon and denies the natural path of growth and development that lead to the present emergent holon. Neither of these things is helpful. If you hate the path that brought you here, and those paths are communal, then there are others on that path at all times who have not yet arrived at your location and to hate the path is to hate those who travel on it. A terrible conflation of categories and denial of development. It's the attainment of organisation through a process and then the denial of the process. It is the valuing of a state of organisation as better than another, and then the denial of the legitimacy of the other. 

# 21 **Evolution - Devolution**
[Evolution - Devolution](Evolution%20-%20Devolution.md) 
Evolution pulls parts and wholes towards ever greater expression and fulfilment of potential, it's exploratory, speculative, probabilistic and perpetual, but not deterministic, that remains probabilistic, possible but not sufficient. The current of eros is necessary but not sufficient and is causal, but not teleological, because... while emergence is perpetual, change (in any direction) is probable. 
Devolution is a relative regression on the same scale that evolution operates on. Devolution is different from entropy in that it still applies to living organisms who can maintain themselves at a given level in a given context. Once life is lost from an organism that self-maintaining ability at the level of open living organism” goes away a regression to a state of self-organisation and self-sustainment below that of life comes into play - lower orders of life, then chemistry then physics - that is bacterial and biological decay and eventually further decomposition to a particular point at which reuptake into the living cycle or other forms happens.

Geo material comes together according to physical laws to form all kinds of matter, which is subsumed and contained within biological forms and behaves according to biological laws, which are subsumed and contained within and behave according to conscious laws. mind, or interiority, or the ability for sensation to arise, experience in another word, occurs at all levels of complexity and development, complex bodies can support complex minds and therefore complex experience which after a certain threshold starts to look like something separate which Descartes called “mind". And spirit through involution is in-volved in everything at all levels and is the consciousness at the root of all experience at all levels. It is inseparable from its material dimension but not reducible to it. Values on the x -axis don't arise from y and z values, and can't be reduced to them, but it can be better understood in terms of them. 
Evolution for the individual tends towards ever-more wholeness as a part, and evolution for collectives tends towards ever-greater embrace as collective.

# 22 Syntropy - Entropy
Constructive - Deconstructive, Accumulative - Dissipative, [Orthogenesis](Definitions.md#^0aa05a).
[Syntropy & Entropy](Syntropy%20&%20Entropy.md)
Processes that enable the exploration of evolution and the retreat of devolution through the maintenance and expression of eros and agape in every instant at every level.

# 23 Orthogenesis

^0aa05a

[Orthogenesis - Wikipedia](Orthogenesis%20-%20Wikipedia.md)
#Orthogenesis, also known as **orthogenetic #evolution**, **progressive evolution**, **evolutionary progress**, or **progressionism**, is the biological [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) that [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism") have an innate tendency to [evolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") in a definite direction [towards some goal (teleology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology "Teleology") due to some internal mechanism or "driving force".

# 24 Coaching
Collection of things that need to be considered for a definition of coaching:
Coaching is an idealised form or process in which coach, client, context (and?) define what happens within that - focused on an ideal realisation of imagined potential.

Coaching is the application of integrated logical dialectics in intra or interpersonal conversation for the purpose of assisting positive (however construed) change. Wherever this happens, coaching is happening.



# 25 Transcendent
#better #higher #01 +1
It's not right v wrong, just the container in which right and wrong can occur. None of these are ultimates - ultimates are not the ends of things, but the immediacy of any thing now.
I need to do something on [Core Arguments](Core%20Arguments.md) in this section I would need to include things like, why I am choosing one thing over another, like process ontology over substance ontologies, or why one thing that includes another is better than one that excludes something in a denial. What is better should not deny, but find a way to include, even if it trims some of the included bits. A view than can include another one and still propose something that transcends it, is not a competitive view to be seen on the same level, but one that should be seen as, and diagnostic of, or characteristic of what is better. When you're included and transcended, you can't reject or deny, because you have been exceeded and reflection on that excession is required.

# 26 **Awareness**
The formal sensitivity(?) of an individual holon of itself at its evolutionary level - it is the inner view of the AQAL [zones](Zones.md). It is concerned with inner parts and relations in AQ and at AL. All sciences apply inwardly as they are appropriate in the compound of the organism, or other whole. Animate or not, it doesn't matter.

# 27 **Consciousness**
The causal, non-formal which is the source of all formal experience. Consciousness and form are distinguishable and identical. They are not each other, but are not other than each other. The contact of consciousness and awareness result in experience 


# 28 **Development**
Is a progression from a smaller container to a larger one. The larger being able to contain and organise more. It's not only that there is more 0, it's that there are higher orders of 0 that can only fit into larger containers, and that aspect of it is only possible in larger containers.
This might be a way of looking at horizontal and vertical development in relation to, for example, intelligence.
horizontal dev is the dev that fills up a given 0 more and more completely, but can't do anything that's 0+1, only 0 and 0-1. So there's additive - horizontal and transformative that is transordinal - it allows a new ordinal to emerge and subsume the current order of things within it and then progress with the population of that level at its own ordinal value.
Intelligence then is the power behind both directions - at a given level of organisation or 0, it can fill up more and more 0 but can't reach 0+1. Some orders of complexity might not be able to run in a given intelligence, or mental capacity - processing power - so that would be a limiting feature of intelligence on development. In humans and in other species.
Intelligence inheres in complexity.
