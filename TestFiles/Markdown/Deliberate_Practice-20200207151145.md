# Deliberate practice 
Is the only serious way of becoming better at what we do.
This allies with the notion of Petersen's notion that voluntarily facing life in all it's ways is how we make progress.
Which is to say, "face healthy change and thereby decrease partiality"
Deliberate practice is a choice, an attitude or orientation that is helpful to have in confronting and dealing with change items.

The ones that take us a step closer to the ultimate unachievable goal are good actions, thoughts, feelings and so on.
