Directionality has a few aspects to it. One if that there's a slope to the cosmos, this is the pull up that is expressed in the erotic drive. Teleology might be something to deal with, as might dissipation / entropy that gives time its direction (if that's what it does). But it also has to do with LoA, causality, non-determinism and probably other things.
For example, in mixing the UNC elements, you can talk about the kinds of things that could emerge given a particular intersection of elements, but you can't say for certain. Once something does emerge it can be described and defined in terms of the LoA that precede it, but you can't do it the other way around. For example, in every brain, you will find *n* fundamental particles, but you will not find a brain in the same number of particles. To describe a brain in quantum terms is to describe an aircraft in terms of its ore. It's a reductionism based on the false premise that attributes aggregated in complex, evolved systems can be taken as given and described in terms of their basic components. Fundamental particles don't contemplate the origins of the cosmos, and they never can, however brains do. 

One aspect of directionality is that high-order holons or stages or whatever are not predictable, reducible, or explicable by lower-order constituent holons. Higher order holons contain and explain lower-order holons and also experience emergence - that is the appearance of new properties that are not present in lower-order holons and therefore, because of emergence, lower-order holons cannot explain, predict, etc. the properties of the higher-order holons that they make up. 

The lower down you get - the more elementary, or lower-order a holon is, the more common it is to the higher order, but the less it explains. Atoms are everywhere, but have no explanatory power at all over higher-order holons, such as bacteria, which have no explanatory power over morals, etc.

### _Quote 1:_

> “Pleasure and pain moreover supply the motives of desire and of avoidance, and the springs of conduct generally. This being so, it clearly follows that actions are right and praiseworthy only as being a means to the attainment of a life of pleasure. But that which is not itself a means to anything else, but to which all else is a means, is what the Greeks term the telos, the highest, ultimate or final Good.” ― Epicurus

Here, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus explains his own philosophy, [Epicureanism](https://philosophyterms.com/epicureanism/ "Epicureanism"), which urges us to live the most enjoyable lives possible; and, he justifies this philosophy with Aristotle’s definition of human telos, the “highest good” — that which is not a means to anything else, and to which all else is a means. Aristotle’s highest good was _eudemonia_, understood to mean happiness, well-being, and the fulfillment of one’s potential for good.
